(3) Obviously we want to take one of the points to be the origin  x 1  = 0  as it is where we want to find the speed. At this location the kinetic energy is related to the speed by  K ( x 1 ) =  K (0) =  mv 2 0 / 2 . However, the second point requires more thought.

Initially the elevator is at rest. The elevator then begins to ascend to the sixth floor, which is a distance  h  above the starting point. The elevator undergoes an unknown constant acceleration  a  for a time  t 1 . Then the elevator moves at a constant velocity for a time interval  ∆ t 2  = 4 t 1 . Finally, the elevator brakes with a deceleration of the same magnitude as the initial acceleration for a time interval  ∆ t 3  =  t 1 , until stopping at the sixth floor. Assume the gravitational constant is given as  g . Find the magnitude of the acceleration. 1. Sketch the position, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time. 2. Briefly explain how you intend to model this problem and write down your strategy before solving it. 3. Use numbers from your everyday experience to estimate the height  h  and the time  t 1  and check if your answer makes sense. 2 ', 'answer': '1. The acceleration, velocity, and position as a function of time are plotted below. 2. There are three stages of motion given in the problem and we note that the problem is one-dimensional. The first and third stages are at constant acceleration and the second stage is at constant velocity. We have seen similar problems before. The connection between the stages is that the final speed after the first stage is the constant speed during the second stage and the initial speed for the third stage. Additionally, the position at the end of the first stage is the initial position for the second stage and the position at the end of the second stage is the initial position for the third stage. 3. From projectile motion, we know the general solution for the acceleration, velocity, and position during any constant acceleration  a  is a ( t ) =  a v ( t ) =  at  +  v 0 y ( t ) =   a 2 t 2  +  v 0 t  +  y 0 respectively. During the first stage the acceleration is  a  =  a . Thus, after a time interval  t 1  the elevator has an upward speed and displacement of v 1  =  v ( t 1 ) =  at 1 ∆ y 1  =  y ( t 1 )  − y 0  =   a 2 t 2 1 respectively, where we must remember that the acceleration  a  is positive and unknown. During the second stage, the elevator has a constant acceleration of  a  = 0 , so the upward speed and displacement are v ( t ) =  v 0  =  v 1  =  at 1 y ( t )  − y 0  =  v 0 t  =  v 1 t  =  at 1 t, where we note that here  t  is the time since the second stage began. Thus, after a time interval  ∆ t 2  = 4 t 1 the elevator has a velocity and displacement of v 2  =  v (∆ t 2 ) =  at 1 ∆ y 2  =  y (∆ t 2 )  − y 0  = 4 at 2 1 . During the third stage, we have constant acceleration of  a  =  − a , so the upward speed and displacement are v ( t ) =  − at  +  v 0  =  − at  +  at 1 y ( t )  − y 0  =  − a 2 t 2  +  v 0 t  =  − a 2 t 2  +  at 1 t. After a time interval  ∆ t 3  =  t 1 , the upward speed and displacement is v 3  =  v (∆ t 3 ) = 0 ∆ y 3  =  y (∆ t 3 )  − y 0  =  − a 2 t 2 1   +  at 1 t 1   =  a 2 t 2 1 respectively. Thus, the total distance traveled is the sum of the displacements in the three stages and is also equal to the height of the building  h , so h  = ∆ y 1  + ∆ y 2  + ∆ y 3  =   a 2 t 2 1   + 4 at 2 1   +  a 2 t 2 1   = 5 at 2 1 . Solving this equation for the acceleration gives the solution of a  =   h 5 t 2 1 . 4. Let’s assume that the sixth floor is about  h  ≈ 25  m above the ground. This happens to be a slow elevator, taking approximately  30  s to reach the top so  t 1  ≈ 5  s. Therefore, the acceleration is: a  ≈ 25  m 5  ×  (5  s ) 2  ≈ 0 . 2  m s 2  . This number is reasonable as it is around 2% of the gravitational acceleration. In a slow elevator, one barely notices that the elevator is accelerating. 9 ', 'course': 'Physique meca'}, {'question': 'Where did the BlackHat 2016 speakers got their slides from?\\n', 'answer': 'They hacked the MI5 web site and took their slides from https://careers.mi5.gov.uk:8443\\n', 'course': 'Cryptography and Security'}, {'question': ' For the question, mark the box (without erasing) TRUE if the statement is  always true  and the box FALSE if it is  not always true  (i.e., it is sometimes false).

Given the information from the problem, we can directly calculate the acceleration in each time interval to be a 1  =  ∆ v 1 ∆ t 1 =  72  km hr   − 0  km hr 1  min = 72 km hr-min   × 1  hr 60  min   ×  1  min 60  s   ×  1  min 60  s   ×  1000  m 1  km =  1 3 m s 2 a 2  =  ∆ v 2 ∆ t 2 =  72  km hr   − 72  km hr 5  min = 0 a 3  =  ∆ v 3 ∆ t 3 =   − ∆ v 1 2∆ t 1 =  − 1 2 a 1  =  − 1 6 m s 2  , where the subscript refers to the first, second, and third time intervals respectively. In figure 4, we use these values to plot the acceleration as a function of time. 6 Figure 4: The acceleration of the train (in m/s 2 ) as a function of time (in s). Given that we know the acceleration, it is natural to calculate the velocity next. We will denote the velocity throughout each of the time intervals by  v i ( t ) , where the subscript  i  equals  1 ,  2 , or  3  and refers to the first, second, or third time interval respectively. Similarly, we will denote the initial velocity of the  i th   time interval to be  v 0 ,i . During all time intervals the acceleration is constant, so we can apply equations (1) and (2) from problem 4. Equation (1) becomes v i ( t ) =  a i t  +  v 0 ,i , (6) where  a i  is the acceleration during the time interval that we have calculated above. Importantly, using the form of equation (1) requires that we define the start of each time interval to be  t  = 0 . This means that we are defining a separate time coordinate system for each time interval. Keeping track and correctly handling these different time coordinates is one of the most challenging parts of the problem. It is possible to calculate everything on a single time coordinate, but the mathematics become more complicated. Since the train started with  v 0 , 1  = 0 , during the first time interval equation (6) is v 1 ( t ) =  a 1 t  = \\x12 1 3 m s 2 \\x13 t. Therefore, at the interface between time intervals 1 and 2, the train is traveling at  v 1 (60  s ) = 20  m / s  =  v 0 , 2 . Substituting this initial velocity and  a 2  = 0  into equation (6), we see that the velocity during the second interval is a constant value of v 2 ( t ) =  v 0 , 2  = 20   m s   . Thus, the initial condition for the third time interval is  v 2 (300  s ) = 20  m / s  =  v 0 , 3 , so v 3 ( t ) =  a 3 t  +  v 0 , 3  = \\x12 − 1 6 m s 2 \\x13 t  + 20   m s   . To produce the plot for velocity we need to combine these three results. However, we must remember to account for the different time coordinate systems by shifting the second time interval by 60 s and the third time interval by 300 s + 60 s = 360 s. This gives figure 5. Lastly, we can calculate the positions analogously to the velocities, using equation (2) instead of equation (1). We see that the position during each time interval changes quadratically as a function of time according to x i ( t ) =  1 2 a i t 2  +  v 0 ,i t  +  x 0 ,i , (7) 7 Figure 5: The velocity of the train (in m/s) as a function of time (in s). where  x 0 ,i  is the initial position of the train during the  i th   time interval. Again, we are defining a separate time coordinate for each time interval such that the start of every time interval is  t  = 0 . We will take x  =  x 0 , 1  = 0  to be the initial location of the train at the start of the first time interval. We showed above that  v 0 , 1  = 0 , so during the first time interval equation (7) becomes x 1  =  1 2 \\x12 1 3 m s 2 \\x13 t 2   = \\x12 1 6 m s 2 \\x13 t 2 . At the interface between time intervals 1 and 2, the train is located at  x 1 (60  s ) = 600  m  =  x 0 , 2 . Given that we found  v 0 , 2  = 20  m / s above, the position throughout the second time interval is x 2  = \\x10 20   m s \\x11 t  + 600  m . At the interface between time intervals 2 and 3, the train is located at  x 2 (300  s ) = 6600  m  =  x 0 , 3 . Given that  v 0 , 3  = 20  m / s from above, the position throughout the third time interval is x 3  =  1 2 \\x12 − 1 6 m s 2 \\x13 t 2   + \\x10 20   m s \\x11 t  + 6600  m . Again combining the three time intervals, shifting the second and third in time by 60 s and 360 s respectively, we produce figure 6. 8 Figure 6: The position of the train (in m) as a function of time (in s). 9 ', 'course': 'Physique meca'}, {'question': ' For the question, mark the box (without erasing) TRUE if the statement is  always true  and the box FALSE if it is  not always true  (i.e., it is sometimes false).

This implies that ⃗ F r  =  F rx ˆ x  =  F r ˆ x (7) must be purely in the  ˆ x  direction. Through substitution into equation (4), we see that the same is true for ⃗ F l  =  Ma ˆ x  − F r ˆ x  = ( Ma  − F r ) ˆ x  =  F l ˆ x. (8) Taking the dot product of both sides of this equation with  ˆ x , we find Ma  − F r  =  F l ⇒ F r  +  F l  =  Ma. (9) Thus, the additional forces from each hand must only have an  ˆ x  component and satisfy  F r  +  F l  =  Ma . 4 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 2. This problem is tricky because there are two different types of rotation. There is the rotation of the hoop about the axis, which has a constant magnitude  ω h  that starts out in the  ˆ x  direction at  t  = 0 . However, it changes direction because the bar is made to rotate about its center with a constant angular velocity  ω b ˆ z . The second type of rotation (i.e. the rotation of the bar in the  x - y  plane) causes the angular momentum to change. To quantify this second type of rotation, we will use the cylindrical coordinate system shown in the figure below (which shows the wheel from a top view relative to the figure in the problem statement). ω h ϕ ω h x z y ρ z ϕ We can write the total angular momentum of the system (including both types of rotation) as ⃗ L sys  =   ⃗ L h  +   ⃗ L b  =  I h ω h ˆ ρ  +  I b ω b ˆ z, (10) where  ˆ ρ  is changing with time and the subscripts  h  and  b  indicate the hoop and bar respectively. The hoop is thin and rotating about its center, so its moment of inertia is  I h  =  MR 2 . The bar is massless, but its rotation also rotates the hoop about its diameter. Thus, it has a moment of inertia of  I b  =  MR 2 / 2 , which we have found from a table noting that the hoop is thin (meaning it has zero width). Substituting these values into equation (10), we find ⃗ L sys  =  MR 2 ω h ˆ ρ  +   M 2   R 2 ω b ˆ z. (11) A change in angular momentum is always caused by a net torque, which can be found from Newton’s second law for rotation ⃗ τ net  =   d⃗ L sys dt . (12) Substituting equation (11) gives ⃗ τ net  =   d dt \\x12 MR 2 ω h ˆ ρ  +   M 2   R 2 ω b ˆ z \\x13 =  MR 2 ω h d ˆ ρ dt  . (13) In lecture 4a, we calculated the derivatives of the cylindrical unit vectors, finding that  d ˆ ρ/dt  = ( dϕ/dt ) ˆ ϕ . Since the bar is changing angular position  ϕ  at a constant angular speed  ω b  =  dϕ/dt , we can write d ˆ ρ/dt  =  ω b   ˆ ϕ . Substituting this into equation (13) produces ⃗ τ net  =  MR 2 ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ. (14) This torque must arise from the forces applied at the end of the bar by the demonstrator’s hands. Thus, analogously to equation 2, we have ⃗ τ net  =  ⃗ τ r  +  ⃗ τ l  =  ⃗ r r  ×   ⃗ F r  +  ⃗ r l  ×   ⃗ F l  =  ℓ ˆ ρ  ×   ⃗ F r  − ℓ ˆ ρ  ×   ⃗ F l  =  MR 2 ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ (15) ⇒ ˆ ρ  × \\x10 ⃗ F r  − ⃗ F l \\x11 =   MR 2 ℓ ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ, (16) 5 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 where we must take into account the rotation of the bar into our expression for the radial position of the demonstrator’s hands by using  ˆ ρ  instead of  ˆ x . Additionally, we know that the center of the bar (i.e. the center of mass of the system) has no translational motion. Thus, by Newton’s first law, the net force must be equal to ⃗ F net  =   ⃗ F r  +   ⃗ F l  = 0 ⇒ ⃗ F l  =  − ⃗ F r . (17) Substituting this into equation (16) gives ˆ ρ  × \\x10 ⃗ F r  +   ⃗ F r \\x11 =   MR 2 ℓ ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ ⇒ ˆ ρ  ×   ⃗ F r  =   MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ. (18) Writing out   ⃗ F r  =  F rρ ˆ ρ  +  F rϕ   ˆ ϕ  +  F rz ˆ z  component-by-component in cylindrical coordinates shows that ˆ ρ  × \\x10 F rρ ˆ ρ  +  F rϕ   ˆ ϕ  +  F rz ˆ z \\x11 =   MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ ⇒ F rϕ ˆ z  − F rz   ˆ ϕ  =   MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ. (19) Looking at each component of this equation, we see that we must have  F rϕ  = 0  and − F rz  =   MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b ⇒ F rz  =  − MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b . (20) Plugging this into equation (17) shows that  F lϕ  = 0  and F lz  =   MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b . (21) Thus, our final answer is ⃗ F r  =  F ρr  ˆ ρ  − MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b ˆ z (22) ⃗ F l  =  − F ρr  ˆ ρ  +   MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b ˆ z. (23) We see that the radial component of the force in unconstrained as long as it is equal and opposite according to equation (17). This is intuitive as the tension in the bar will transmit the force along the bar, while not affecting its motion. Less intuitive is the fact that, to get the bar to rotate in the   ˆ ϕ direction, you must apply forces in the  ˆ z  direction. This is the nature of a gyroscope — applying a force creates motion in a perpendicular direction.

The wheel has moment of inertia about its center of mass of I p  =  m p R 2 / 2 . A massless inextensible cord is wrapped around the wheel and is used to create a funicular. One end of the cord is attached to a car of mass  m 2  that can slide up or down a frictionless inclined plane. The other end of the cord is attached to a counterweight of mass  m 1  that hangs off the edge of the inclined plane. The plane is inclined from the horizontal by an angle  θ . Once the objects are released from rest, the cord moves without slipping around the wheel. Calculate the speed of the car  v ( d )  as a function of the distance  d  that it moves  down  the inclined plane using energy conservation. Assume there is no friction nor drag in the system. θ R m 1 m 2 m p ', 'answer': 'Since there are no nonconservative forces in the problem, we can impose conservation of mechanical energy on the entire system (i.e. car, counterweight, and pulley) and write E mi  =  E mf , (1) where the  i  subscript indicates the state just before the funicular is released and the  f  subscript indicates the state after the car has moved a distance  d . We will quantify the positions of the car and counterweight ( x 2  and  y 1  respectively) using the coordinate systems shown in the diagram below. 2 θ R m 1 m 2 m p x 2 y 1 We will choose the reference point for the gravitational potential energy to be at the height of the center of the pulley, which we see is at  x 2  = 0  and  y 1  = 0 . The initial mechanical energy is only the gravitational potential energy of the car and counterweight (as the center of mass of the pulley is at the reference point of the gravitational potential). Thus, we have E mi  =  U gi  =  − m 1 gy 1 i  − m 2 gx 2 i  sin  θ, (2) where  y 1 i  is the initial position of the counterweight and  x 2 i  is the initial position of the car. After the cart has moved by a distance  d , the mechanical energy is composed of the gravitational potential energy of the car and counterweight, the translational kinetic energy of the car and counterweight, and the rotational kinetic energy of the pulley. This can be written as E mf  =  U gf  +  K f  = ( − m 1 gy 1  − m 2 gx 2  sin  θ ) + \\x12 m 1 2   v 2 1   +  m 2 2   v 2 2   +  I p 2   ω 2 \\x13 , (3) where  x 2  and  y 1  are the locations of the car and counterweight respectively,  v 1  and  v 2  are the speeds of the counterweight and car respectively, and  ω  is the angular speed of the pulley. Since the rope is inextensible and directly connects the two blocks, the car and the counterweight (as well as every point of the rope) move at the same speed. This is the constraint condition, which is expressed as v  =  v 1  =  v 2 . (4) Since the rope does not slip on the pulley, the points on the outer rim of the pulley move with a tangential speed  v ϕ  equal to the speed of the rope, car, and counterweight v ϕ  =  Rω  =  v ⇒ ω  =   v R . (5) Thus, using equations (4) and (5), we can write equation (3) as E mf  =  − m 1 gy 1  − m 2 gx 2  sin  θ  +   m 1 2   v 2  +  m 2 2   v 2  +  I p 2 v 2 R 2  .

The track forms the rim of an otherwise massless wheel, which is free to rotate without friction about a vertical axis. The locomotive starts from rest and accelerates without slipping to a final speed of  v  relative to the track . What is the locomotive’s final speed  v f  relative to the ground ?', 'answer': 'We begin by choosing our system to consist of the locomotive and the track. Because there are no  external torques about the central vertical axis, the angular momentum of our system must remain constant about that axis ⃗ L i sys   =  ⃗ L f sys . (1) The initial angular momentum of the system is ⃗ L i sys   = 0 (2) because both the locomotive and the track are at rest. The final angular momentum will be composed of the angular momentum of the locomotive and the track according to ⃗ L f sys   =  ⃗ L f L   +  ⃗ L f T   , (3) where the subscripts  L  and  T  refer to the locomotive and track respectively. The final angular momentum of the locomotive (which can be considered to be a point mass) is given by ⃗ L f L   =  ⃗ R L  ×  ⃗ p L  =  R T  ˆ r  ×  m L ⃗ v L , (4) where  ⃗ r L  is the position vector from the pivot point at the top of the vertical axis to the locomotive,  ⃗ p L  is momentum of the locomotive in the ground reference frame, and  ⃗ v L  is the velocity of the locomotive relative to the ground. From the figure we see that the locomotive is moving only in the   ˆ ϕ  direction, so  ⃗ v L  =  v f   ˆ ϕ 2 Angular momentum - 12 (where  v f  is the final speed relative to the floor that we are trying to determine). Plugging this into equation (4) produces ⃗ L f L   =  R T  ˆ r  ×  m L v f   ˆ ϕ  =  R T  m L v f  ˆ z, (5) where the   ˆ ϕ  unit vector points counter-clockwise (when viewed from above) and the  ˆ z  unit vector points upwards. Next we must determine the final angular momentum of the track (which is a continuous system). We know that the moment of inertia of a thin uniform ring about an axis passing through its center is I T  =  m T  R 2 T   . (6) This can also be calculated from the definition of the moment of inertia according to I T  = Z ring ρ 2 dm  = Z ring ρ 2 λdl ϕ  = Z ring ρ 2 λρdϕ  =  λρ 3 Z  2 π 0 dϕ  =  λR 3 T   (2 π  − 0) = \\x12  m T 2 πR T \\x13 R 3 T   2 π  =  m T   R 2 T (7) using the linear mass density  λ  =  m T  / (2 πR T  ) =  dm/dl ϕ  and the arc length along the track  l ϕ  =  ρϕ . Using the definition of the angular momentum of a continuous system, we know that the final angular momentum of the track is ⃗ L f T   =  I T  ⃗ ω f , (8) where  ⃗ ω f  is the final angular velocity of the track. The angular velocity can be related to the tangential velocity of any point on the track through ⃗ ω f  =   ⃗ ρ  ×  ⃗ v ϕ ρ 2 = R T  ˆ ρ  × \\x10 − v T   ˆ ϕ \\x11 R 2 T =  − v T  ˆ ρ  ×   ˆ ϕ R T =  − v T R T ˆ z, (9) where  v T  is the final tangential speed of the track relative to the ground and we have deduced its direction from imagining the physical situation (i.e. by Newton’s third law, if the locomotive goes one way, the track must go the other).

(10) Unfortunately, we do not know the tangential speed of the track  v T  . However, we can find it from information given in the problem statement. Specifically, we know the speed of the locomotive relative to the track  v . The formula for converting velocities between different reference frames is ⃗ v gL  =  ⃗ v gT  +  ⃗ v T L ⇒ v f   ˆ ϕ  =  − v T   ˆ ϕ  +  v   ˆ ϕ ⇒ v T  =  v  − v f , (11) where  ⃗ v gL  =  v f   ˆ ϕ  is the velocity of the locomotive in the reference frame of the ground,  ⃗ v gT  =  − v T   ˆ ϕ  is the velocity of the track in the reference frame of the ground, and  ⃗ v T L  =  v   ˆ ϕ  is the velocity of the locomotive in the reference frame of the  track . Plugging this into equation (10) gives ⃗ L f T   =  − m T  R T  ( v  − v f ) ˆ z, (12) which is now composed exclusively of known quantities and the parameter we are trying to find  v f . Finally, we can substitute equations (2), (3), (5), and (12) into equation (1) to find the final answer of 0 =   ⃗ L f L   +  ⃗ L f T ⇒ 0 =  R T  m L v f  ˆ z  − m T  R T  ( v  − v f ) ˆ z ⇒ v f  = m T m L  +  m T v.

Note that the problem is one dimensional. Next, 6 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - 7 at an arbitrary time  t , we consider a system that is composed of the rocket including  all  the fuel it currently contains, which we will denote as having a total instantaneous mass  m r . The instantaneous speed of the rocket is  v r , so we can draw the momentum diagram shown below at time  t . A very short time later at t  + ∆ t , the rocket has ejected a differential mass element  ∆ m f  of fuel, which slightly alters the mass of the rocket to  m r  + ∆ m r . Note that it is important allow an arbitrary change in the rocket’s mass by  +∆ m r . This will help to prevent sign errors later in the derivation (e.g. accidentally accounting for the fact that the rocket’s mass is decreasing twice) and accommodate more general calculations where the mass is changing due to several mechanisms. After ejecting the differential mass element, the velocity of the rocket is also slightly changed to be  v r  + ∆ v r . We must also include the momentum of the ejected fuel as it is still part of the system. It has a mass of  ∆ m f  and a velocity of  − u ˆ y  relative to the rocket . This means that it has a velocity of  ( v r  − u )ˆ y  in the inertial laboratory frame. We have drawn the momentum diagram at time  t  + ∆ t below. time  t time  t  + Δ t g m r v r v r  + Δ v r Δ m f m r  + Δ m r v r  − u y From the momentum diagram, we can use conservation of mass in the system to see that m r  =  m r  + ∆ m r  + ∆ m f ⇒ ∆ m f  =  − ∆ m r . (1) Additionally, we see that the total momentum of the system at time  t  is ⃗ p sys ( t ) =  m r v r ˆ y, (2) while at time  t  + ∆ t  it is ⃗ p sys ( t  + ∆ t ) = ( m r  + ∆ m r )( v r  + ∆ v r )ˆ y  + ∆ m f ( v r  − u )ˆ y  = ( m r  + ∆ m r )( v r  + ∆ v r )ˆ y  − ∆ m r ( v r  − u )ˆ y,  (3) making use of equation (1). We can now write down the generalized form of Newton’s second law and use the limit form of the time derivative according to ⃗ F   ext net   =  d⃗ p sys dt = lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ ⃗ p sys ∆ t = lim ∆ t → 0 ⃗ p sys ( t  + ∆ t )  − ⃗ p sys ( t ) ∆ t . (4) If we drew a free body diagram, we’d see that the only external force on the system is gravity   ⃗ F   ext net   =  − m r g ˆ y . Using this and substituting equations (2) and (3) into equation (4), we find − m r g  = lim ∆ t → 0 ( m r  + ∆ m r )( v r  + ∆ v r )  − ∆ m r ( v r  − u )  − m r v r ∆ t = lim ∆ t → 0 m r ∆ v r  + ∆ m r ∆ v r  + ∆ m r u ∆ t (5) in the  ˆ y  direction. We can neglect the  ∆ m r ∆ v r  term in this expression as it is product of two differential elements. Since the differential elements are infinitesimally small, a product of two differential elements will be much smaller than terms that include just one differential element (e.g.  ∆ m r ∆ v r  ≪ m r ∆ v r ). Thus, equation (5) becomes − m r g  =  m r  lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ v r ∆ t   + lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ m r ∆ t  u. (6) 7 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - 7 Converting the limits back into derivatives, we find the differential equation − m r g  =  m r dv r dt   +  dm r dt  u. (7) Now, as in problem 2, we must determine  dm r /dt , the rate of change of the mass of the rocket (including the fuel it contains). We know that, at take-off when  t  = 0 , the total mass of the rocket and fuel is  M . Additionally, it ejects fuel at a constant rate of  D . Thus, the total mass of the rocket as a function of time is m r ( t ) =  M  − Dt, (8) which gives dm r dt =  − D (9) after taking a derivative. Substituting this result into equation (7) gives the differential equation − m r g  =  m r dv r dt   − Du. (10) Rearranging and using equation (8) gives dv r dt   =  − g  + Du M  − Dt . (11) The problem statement ultimately asks us to find the speed and altitude of the rocket. Thus, we will integrate equation (11) to find the velocity v r ( t ) =  − Z gdt  + Z Du M  − Dt dt. (12) The first integral is straightforward, but to accomplish the second we must perform a change of variables. We know the integral of  1 /x 1  is the natural logarithm, so we will let x 1  =  M  − Dt (13) and rewrite v r ( t ) =  − Z gdt  +  Du Z 1 x 1 dt dx 1 dx 1 . (14) Solving equation (13) for  t  =  M/D  − x 1 /D  and taking a derivative gives  dt/dx 1  =  − 1 /D . Substituting this, taking the integrals, and using equation (13) gives v r ( t ) =  − Z gdt  +  Du Z 1 x 1 \\x12 − 1 D \\x13 dx 1  =  − gt  − u  ln( x 1 ) +  C 1  =  − gt  − u  ln( M  − Dt ) +  C 1 , (15) where  C 1  is a constant of integration. It can be determined by using the initial condition that the rocket is at rest at  t  = 0 , i.e.  v r (0) = 0 . This gives v r (0) = 0 =  − u  ln( M ) +  C 1 ⇒ C 1  =  u  ln( M ) . (16) Substituting this into equation (15) and using the property of logarithms that  ln( A ) − ln( B ) = ln( A/B )  gives v r ( t ) =  − gt  − u  ln( M  − Dt ) +  u  ln( M ) =  − gt  − u  ln \\x12 M  − Dt M \\x13 .

We can use the second hint in the problem statement if we first perform a change of variables to x 2  =   M  − Dt M . (19) This allows us to write equation (18) as y r ( t ) =  − Z gtdt  − u Z ln ( x 2 )   dt dx 2 dx 2 . (20) Solving equation (19) for  t  =  − M/D ( x 2  − 1)  and taking a derivative gives  dt/dx 2  =  − M/D . Substituting this, taking the integrals via hint 2, and using equation (19) gives y r ( t ) =  − Z gtdt  − u Z ln ( x 2 ) \\x12 − M D \\x13 dx 2  =  − g 2 t 2  +  Mu D  x 2  (ln( x 2 )  − 1) +  C 2 (21) =  − g 2 t 2  +  Mu D M  − Dt M \\x12 ln \\x12 M  − Dt M \\x13 − 1 \\x13 +  C 2  =  − g 2 t 2  +  uM  − Dt D \\x12 ln \\x12 M  − Dt M \\x13 − 1 \\x13 +  C 2 , (22) where  C 2  is an integration constant. It can be determined by using the initial condition that the rocket starts on the ground at  t  = 0 , i.e.  y r (0) = 0 . This gives y r (0) = 0 =  u M D   (ln (1)  − 1) +  C 2 ⇒ C 2  =  − u M D   ( − 1) =  uM D  .

We know that the total amount of fuel is  m t  and it is ejected at a rate of  D . Thus, the fuel will be completely used up at a time  t f  =  m t /D  after launch.

By assumption  κ 1  and  κ 2  are valid kernels. Hence there exist feature maps  φ 1  and  φ 2  so that κ 1 ( x ,  x ′ ) =  φ 1 ( x ) ⊤ φ 1 ( x ′ ) , κ 2 ( x ,  x ′ ) =  φ 2 ( x ) ⊤ φ 2 ( x ′ ) . Hence, κ ( x ,  x ′ ) =  aφ 1 ( x ) ⊤ φ 1 ( x ′ ) +  bφ 2 ( x ) ⊤ φ 2 ( x ′ ) . This can be represented as an inner product via the feature map ( √ aφ 1 ( · ) , √ bφ 2 ( · )) . 2. Let the two feature maps be  φ 1  and  φ 2 . Assume that they are of dimensions  d 1  and  d 2 . Then  φ  is a feature map of dimension  d 1 d 2  of the form φ ( x ) ⊤ =(( φ 1 ( x )) 1 ( φ 2 ( x )) 1 ,  · · ·  ,  ( φ 1 ( x )) 1 ( φ 2 ( x )) d 2 ,  · · ·  , ( φ 1 ( x )) d 1 ( φ 2 ( x )) 1 ,  · · ·  ,  ( φ 1 ( x )) d 1 ( φ 2 ( x )) d 2 ) . 3.

Indeed, φ 1 ( f ( x )) ⊤ φ 1 ( f ( x ′ )) =  κ 1 ( f ( x ) , f ( x ′ ) =  κ ( x ,  x ′ ) . 4. Clearly,  φ ( x ) =  f ( x ) will be the corresponding feature map. This problem caused lots of confusion and only few people got full points. Most people did not take the ”easy” route outlined above but stated Mercer’s condition. Recall that if we are given a  κ ( · ,  · ) and a set of points  { x n } N n =1   then we can associate to this an  N  ×  N  matrix  K  with entries  K i,j  =  κ ( x i ,  x j ). Mercer’s condition then requires that this matrix be symmetric and psd for any given set of points. Only few people stated what  K  was with respect to κ . The symmetry was proven correctly by most but almost nobody gave a correct proof of the psd property. E.g., the product of two psd matrices is in general  not  psd. Adding to the confusion, some people ﬁrst stated the correct representation as an inner product and  then  still tried to prove that Mercer’s condition was fulﬁlled. Recall, Mercer’s condition guarantees that  κ  can be written as an inner product. But once you have explicitly provided an inner product representation there is no point in checking Mercer’s condition. Other frequently made assertions: For point 4 many people stated that since the function f maps points from the domain to itself the kernel was “still” valid. Indeed, this is what was asked to prove and the proof is simple. E.g., if you go the psd route you can observe that the matrix is simply now a matrix corresponding to diﬀerent choices of points and that the original matrix had to be psd for  any  choice of points. But simply stating that it was just a valid kernel did not get you any points. y y y y Page 25 / 29 3941009 – I Know All y y y y Page 26 / 29 3941009 – I Know All y y y y', 'course': 'ML'}, {'question': ' For the question, mark the box (without erasing) TRUE if the statement is  always true  and the box FALSE if it is  not always true  (i.e., it is sometimes false).

If you are given that the solution to this differential equation is of the form x ( t ) =  A 0 e − γt   cos ( ω 1 t  +  φ )  , what must be the value of the angular frequency in the presence of damping  ω 1 ? Here  A 0  and  φ  are unknown integration constants. 2.

What is the frequency of this tuning fork in a vacuum f 0  =  ω 0 / (2 π ) ? Is the effect of air significant? 2 ', 'answer': '1. We are given that the solution has the form x ( t ) =  A 0 e − γt   cos ( ω 1 t  +  φ )  . (1) We can determine the coefficients by substitution into the equation that it is supposed to solve.

(5) By substituting equation (5) into the equation for the damped harmonic oscillator given in the problem statement ¨ x  + 2 γ  ˙ x  +  ω 2 0 x  = 0 , (6) we find − γ  ˙ x  +  γω 1 A 0 e − γt   sin ( ω 1 t  +  φ )  − ω 2 1 x  + 2 γ  ˙ x  +  ω 2 0 x  = 0 (7) ⇒ γω 1 A 0 e − γt   sin ( ω 1 t  +  φ ) +  γ  ˙ x  + \\x00 ω 2 0   − ω 2 1 \\x01 x  = 0 .

Therefore, the solution to the equation of motion for the damped harmonic oscillator can be written as x ( t ) =  A 0 e − γt   cos ( ω 1 t  +  φ )  , (13) where  ω 1  = p ω 2 0   − γ 2  and  A 0  and  φ  are determined by initial conditions. To solve this problem, we first need to determine how the amplitude of the oscillation changes with time. From studying equation (13), we see that it is simply  A ( t ) =  C 0 e − γt . Evaluating it at two different times  t 0  and  t 1  and taking the ratio allows us to determine  γ  to be A  ( t 1 ) A  ( t 0 )  =  e − γ ( t 1 − t 0 ) ⇒ γ  = 1 t 1  − t 0 ln \\x12 A  ( t 0 ) A  ( t 1 ) \\x13 .

He pulls down on each rope with a force of magnitude  F  and accelerates upward with a uniform acceleration. Find this uniform acceleration  a . ', 'answer': 'We will explain two different, equally valid approaches to this question. The first method is to draw two separate free body diagrams, one for the painter and one for the platform (both shown below). Since the pulleys are both massless and frictionless, the tension throughout each rope is  F , the magnitude of the force the painter applies to each rope. The painter pulls the ropes downward, so the ropes exert an equal and opposite upward force on the painter by Newton’s third law. Thus, the tension from the ropes pull upwards on both the painter and the platform. Additionally, the platform exerts an upward normal force on the painter, the magnitude of which we denote as  N . By Newton’s third law, there is a reaction normal force from the painter on the platform, which has an equal magnitude  N  and is in the opposite direction. Lastly, there is a downwards gravitational force  m 1 g  on the painter and  m 2 g  on the platform. Painter y F F N m 1 g Platform F F N m 2 g Let  a 1  denote the magnitude of the acceleration of the painter and  a 2  denote the magnitude of the acceleration of the platform. Since the painter is standing on the platform, they both have the same acceleration upwards. Thus, we know a 1  =  a 2  =  a, (1) where we have denoted the common acceleration by the symbol  a . Applying Newton’s second law to the painter in the vertical direction gives 2 F  +  N  − m 1 g  =  m 1 a, (2) while applying Newton’s second law to the platform in the vertical direction gives 2 F  − N  − m 2 g  =  m 2 a. (3) By adding equations (2) and (3), we can eliminate the normal force entirely and find 4 F  − ( m 1  +  m 2 ) g  = ( m 1  +  m 2 ) a. (4)  Solving for the acceleration gives the final answer a  =  4 F  − ( m 1  +  m 2 ) g m 1  +  m 2 = 4 F m 1  +  m 2 − g. (5) A second method to find the same solution is to treat the painter and platform as a single system as we know that they will move together. In this case, the internal forces do not appear in the free body diagram (shown below). The four ropes still act on the combined painter-platform system with the same upward vertical force.

', 'answer': 'In the vertical direction, the ring experiences only gravity and the normal force and does not accelerate. Thus, the vertical component of Newton’s second law for the ring tells us that N  − mg  = 0 ⇒ N  =  mg. (1) 6 Angular momentum - 12 In the horizontal direction, kinetic friction causes a force ⃗ F f  =  − µN  ˆ x  =  − µmg ˆ x, (2) where we have defined the direction of motion of the ring to be the  ˆ x  direction. Since this is the only horizontal force on the ring, Newton’s second law in the  ˆ x  direction tells us that the corresponding acceleration is constant and has a value of F fx  =  ma ⇒ − µmg  =  ma ⇒ a  =  − µg. (3) According to the work-kinetic energy theorem, the change in kinetic energy is equal to the work done by friction. Since the disk starts out with kinetic energy  K i  =  E 0  and finishes at rest with  K f  = 0 , we know that ∆ K  =  W ⇒ K f  − K i  = Z ⃗ F f  ·  d ⃗ l ⇒ 0  − E 0  = Z  ∆ x 0 − µmg ˆ x  ·  (ˆ xdx ) ⇒ E 0  =  µmg ∆ x,  (4) where  ∆ x  is the total distance traveled by the ring and we have used equation (2). The ring undergoes motion under constant acceleration, so we can immediately write down its velocity as v ( t ) =  at  +  v 0  =  − µgt  +  v 0 , (5) where we have used equation (3). We can use this to find the time at which the ring will stop, which gives v ( t 1 ) = 0 =  − µgt 1  +  v 0 ⇒ t 1  =   v 0 µg  . (6) To calculate the initial velocity, we can use the formula for the translational kinetic energy and find K  =   m 2   v 2 ⇒ K i  =  E 0  =   m 2   v 2 0 ⇒ v 0  = r 2 E 0 m  . (7) Substituting this into equation (6) gives the final answer of t 1  =  1 µg r 2 E 0 m  . (8) Alternative solution: Kinetic friction causes a horizontal force, which will reduce the momentum of the ring. Let the initial velocity of the ring be  ⃗ v 0  =  v 0 ˆ x , directed along the horizontal axis  x . The initial momentum and kinetic energy of the ring are ⃗ p 0  =  mv 0 ˆ x (9) K i  =  E 0  =   m 2   v 2 0 (10) respectively. Solving equation (10) for  v 0  and plugging it into equation (9) gives ⃗ p 0  =  m r 2 E 0 m   ˆ x  = p 2 mE 0 ˆ x. (11) The only net horizontal force on the ring arises from kinetic friction, which is given by equation (2). This force   ⃗ F f  is constant. Thus, the generalized version of Newton’s second law,  d⃗ p/dt  =   ⃗ F , can be integrated to show that ⃗ p ( t ) =   ⃗ F f t  +  ⃗ p 0  = \\x10 − µmgt  + p 2 mE 0 \\x11 ˆ x (12) 7 Angular momentum - 12 using equations (2) and (11). From this we can find the time at which the ring comes to rest to be ⃗ p ( t 1 ) = 0 = \\x10 − µmgt 1  + p 2 mE 0 \\x11 ˆ x ⇒ t 1  = 1 µmg p 2 mE 0 ⇒ t 1  =  1 µg r 2 E 0 m  , (13) which is consistent with equation (8) . 2. For the rest of this problem, we use a cylindrical coordinate system  ( ρ, ϕ, z )  with its origin  O at the center of the ring and the vertical  ˆ z  direction pointing  downwards . Friction results in a vertical torque, which will reduce the angular momentum of the ring with time. We will first calculate the initial angular momentum and then find the strength of the torque to determine how quickly it will come to rest. Let  ⃗ ω 0  =  ω 0 ˆ z  be the initial angular velocity with  ˆ z  defined to be downwards such that  ω 0  >  0 . The initial angular momentum about pivot point  O  is then ⃗ L 0  =  I⃗ ω 0  =  Iω 0 ˆ z, (14) where  I  is the moment of inertia about the  ˆ z  axis. The initial kinetic energy of the ring is its rotational kinetic energy, which can be used to find the initial angular velocity to be K i  =  E 0  =   I 2 ω 2 0 ⇒ ω 0  =  ± r 2 E 0 I ⇒ ω 0  = r 2 E 0 I  . (15) Here we have used the fact that  ω 0  >  0  to choose the positive sign in front of the square root. We can plug equation (15) into equation (14) to obtain ⃗ L 0  =  I r 2 E 0 I ˆ z  = p 2 IE 0 ˆ z. (16) Given that the moment of inertia of a thin horizontal ring around the  z -axis, this becomes ⃗ L 0  = q 2 ( mρ 2 0 )  E 0 ˆ z  =  ρ 0 p 2 mE 0 ˆ z. (17) To calculate the torque exerted by the kinetic friction force, we need to integrate around the circum- ference of the ring. A given infinitesimal element of the ring has a mass  ∆ m i , where the subscript denotes which differential element is being considered. Drawing a free body diagram for the differential element  i  shows that the only forces in the vertical direction are gravity  ∆ m i g  and the normal force ∆ N i . Since no part of the ring experiences a vertical acceleration, the vertical component of Newton’s second law gives ∆ N i  − ∆ m i g  = 0 ⇒ ∆ N i  = ∆ m i g. (18) In the tangential   ˆ ϕ  direction, the differential element will experience a kinetic frictional force given by ∆ ⃗ F fi  =  − µ ∆ N i   ˆ ϕ  =  − µ ∆ m i g   ˆ ϕ, (19) which points in the opposite direction to the rotation as to slow the object down. Note that   ˆ ϕ  must point clockwise when viewed from above for the  ( ρ, ϕ, z )  coordinate system to be right-handed. Since the differential element has a position vector of  ⃗ r i  =  ρ i ˆ ρ  =  ρ 0 ˆ ρ , we can calculate the torque from this force to be ∆ ⃗ τ i  =  ⃗ r i  ×  ∆ ⃗ F fi  = ( ρ 0 ˆ ρ )  × \\x10 − µ ∆ m i g   ˆ ϕ \\x11 =  − ρ 0 µ ∆ m i g ˆ ρ  ×   ˆ ϕ  =  − ρ 0 µ ∆ m i g ˆ z. (20) To find the overall torque on the ring  ⃗ τ , we add up the contributions from every differential element, which, in the limit of  ∆ m i  → 0 , becomes the integral ⃗ τ  = lim ∆ m i → 0 X i ∆ ⃗ τ i  = lim ∆ m i → 0 X i ( − ρ 0 µ ∆ m i g ˆ z ) = Z ring ( − ρ 0 µg ˆ z )  dm  =  − ρ 0 µg \\x12Z ring dm \\x13 ˆ z. (21) 8 Angular momentum - 12 Given that the integral of  1  over the entire mass of the object is just the total mass  m , we find ⃗ τ  =  − ρ 0 µg  ( m ) ˆ z. (22) We see that this torque is in the direction opposite to the ring’s angular velocity as is intuitive. Since this torque is constant, integrating the formula  d ⃗ L/dt  =  ⃗ τ  in time shows that ⃗ L ( t ) =  ⃗ τt  +   ⃗ L 0 . (23) Plugging in equations (17) and (22) gives ⃗ L ( t ) =  − ρ 0 µgmt ˆ z  +  ρ 0 p 2 mE 0 ˆ z  =  ρ 0 \\x10p 2 mE 0  − µgmt \\x11 ˆ z. (24) This can be used to calculate the time  t 2  at which the ring stops spinning according to ⃗ L ( t 2 ) = 0 =  ρ 0 \\x10p 2 mE 0  − µgmt 2 \\x11 ˆ z ⇒ t 2  = 1 µgm p 2 mE 0  =  1 µg r 2 E 0 m  . (25) Dividing this by equation (8) shows that the ratio  t 2 /t 1  = 1 . Alternative solution: Since friction does not depend on the surface area, we can consider the torque due to the friction of the ring as equivalent to the torque from a single point mass at the same radius ⃗ τ f  =  ⃗ r  ×   ⃗ F f  = ( ρ 0 ˆ ρ )  × \\x10 − µN   ˆ ϕ \\x11 =  − µNρ 0 ˆ ρ  ×   ˆ ϕ  =  − µmg ˆ z, (26) where we have used  N  =  mg  from Newton’s law in the vertical direction. We can then apply Newton’s second law for rotational motion in the  ˆ z  direction and substitute equation (26) to find Σ ⃗ τ  =  I⃗ α ⇒ ⃗ τ f  =  mρ 2 0 ⃗ α ⇒ − µmgρ 0  =  mρ 2 0 α ⇒ α  =  − µg ρ 0 , (27) where  I  =  mρ 2 0   is the moment of inertia of the ring around the  z  axis and the only net torque is from the friction force. Thus, the angular acceleration is constant in time. Integrating equation (27) in time gives ω ( t ) =  − µg ρ 0 t  +  ω 0 , (28) where  ω 0  is the initial angular velocity at  t  = 0 . Substituting equation (15) and  I  =  mρ 2 0 , this can be used to find the time  t 2  at which the angular velocity becomes zero to be ω ( t 2 ) = 0 =  − µg ρ 0 t 2  + r 2 E 0 I =  − µg ρ 0 t 2  + s 2 E 0 mρ 2 0 ⇒ t 2  =  1 µg r 2 E 0 m  . (29) This is consistent with equation (25). 3.  The calculation of the time  t 1  stays the same because, for pure translation, the object is considered to be a point mass, so it doesn’t matter if the object is a ring or a disk. To find  t 2 , we should first calculate the total torque arising from the frictional force. As in part 2, we can do this by integrating the force acting on all the differential elements that make up the object. The frictional force on a differential mass element is still given by equation (19). However, the torque must take into account that different mass elements can now be located at different radii  ⃗ r i  =  ρ i ˆ ρ . Thus, the torque expressed by equation (20) becomes modified to be ∆ ⃗ τ i  =  ⃗ r i  ×  ∆ ⃗ F fi  = ( ρ i ˆ ρ )  × \\x10 − µ ∆ m i g   ˆ ϕ \\x11 =  − ρ i µ ∆ m i g ˆ ρ  ×   ˆ ϕ  =  − ρ i µ ∆ m i g ˆ z, (30) 9 Angular momentum - 12 where we must remember that we’ve defined   ˆ ϕ  to point clockwise and  ˆ z  to point down. To find the overall torque on the ring  ⃗ τ , we add up the contributions from every differential element, which, in the limit of  ∆ m i  → 0 , becomes the integral ⃗ τ  = lim ∆ m i → 0 X i ∆ ⃗ τ i  = lim ∆ m i → 0 X i ( − ρ i µ ∆ m i g ˆ z ) = Z disk ( − ρ i µg ˆ z )  dm. (31) Given that the disk is uniform, we can use the areal density to show σ  =   m πρ 2 0 =   dm dA ⇒ dm  =   m πρ 2 0 dA, (32) where  dA  is the differential element of area.

(35) We see that this torque is in the direction opposite to the ring’s angular velocity as is intuitive. Since this torque is constant, integrating the formula  d ⃗ L/dt  =  ⃗ τ  (i.e. the generalized version of Newton’s second law for rotation) in time shows that ⃗ L ( t ) =   ⃗ L 0  +  ⃗ τt.

At the peak of its trajectory, the projectile explodes into a thousand pieces, which increases the kinetic energy of the system by  W . The masses of these fragments are not necessarily equal. However, they all have an identical (but unknown) speed  u  measured with respect to the projectile just before it exploded. Lastly, you know that the velocities of all the fragments immediately after the explosion are purely horizontal. Neglect air drag. 1. At what time does the explosion occur?

Calculate  W  in terms of the initial kinetic energy of the projectile.', 'answer': '1.  At what time does the explosion occur? We start by defining a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the cannon, a vertical axis  z pointing upwards, and a horizontal axis  x  such that it contains the horizontal component of  ⃗ v 0 . The projectile undergoes motion under a constant acceleration of  ⃗ g  =  − g ˆ z , so its vertical velocity and position are given by v z ( t ) =  − gt  +  v 0  sin  α (1) z ( t ) =  − g 2 t 2  +  v 0 t  sin  α (2) respectively, where we have used the initial conditions that  v z (0) =  v 0  sin  α  and  z (0) = 0 . The peak of the trajectory is reached when  v z ( t e ) = 0 , so we can use equation (1) to find the time of the explosion t e  to be v z ( t e ) = 0 =  − gt e  +  v 0  sin  α ⇒ t e  =   v 0  sin  α g . (3) At what time do the pieces hit the ground? From equations (2) and (3), we see that the vertical position of the projectile at the time of the explosion is z ( t e ) =  z e  =  − g 2 \\x12 v 0  sin  α g \\x13 2 +  v 0 \\x12 v 0  sin  α g \\x13 sin  α  =  ( v 0  sin  α ) 2 2 g . (4) At this time, the projectile explodes into a thousand pieces, which each still undergo projectile motion. Thus, their height evolves according to z ( t ) =  − g 2 ( t  − t e ) 2  +  z e (5) because their vertical velocity is  v z ( t e ) = 0  and their position is  z ( t e ) =  z e  at time  t  =  t e . From this we can calculate the time  t g  at which they hit the ground  z ( t g ) = 0  to be z ( t g ) = 0 =  − g 2 ( t g  − t e ) 2  +  z e ⇒ t g  =  t e  + r 2 z e g  . (6) 3 Work and energy - 8 Substituting equations (3) and (4) gives t g  =   v 0  sin  α g + s 2 g ( v 0  sin  α ) 2 2 g = 2 v 0  sin  α g . (7) This is a sensible result as the fragments all have zero vertical velocity just before and just after the explosion. Thus, it will take them the same amount of time to fall to the ground as it did for them to ascend. Thus, we’d expect  t g  = 2 t e , which we see is the case by comparing equations (3) and (7). Why do they all hit the ground at the same time? Just before the explosion, the projectile has a purely horizontal velocity (since it is at the peak of its trajectory). As a result of the explosion, the fragments don’t gain any vertical velocity because their velocity relative to the original projectile is purely horizontal. Thus, their velocities relative to the ground are also horizontal just after time  t e . This means that the pieces all have the same height and vertical velocity at  t e . Because gravity accelerates objects the same regardless of mass, they all hit the ground at the same time. 2.  The pieces land on the ground in a circle. Why? Given that we know the time at which the fragments hit the ground, in this part of the problem we will only consider the horizontal motion of the objects and ignore the vertical motion. It is not needed. First, we view the dynamics from the frame of reference moving with the horizontal location of the center of mass of the system (i.e. the projectile). In this frame, we will use cylindrical coordinates with the origin defined to be the ground directly below the location of the center of mass. Immediately after the explosion, all the pieces have the same speed  u  with respect to the origin of our moving frame and are moving purely horizontally. This means their velocity is entirely in the outwards radial direction. In this direction, they experience no acceleration, so their horizontal velocity and position are given by v ρ ( t ) =  u (8) ρ ( t ) =  u ( t  − t e ) (9) for any time  t > t e . Here we used the fact that at  t  =  t e  the horizontal position of every piece is at the origin and the initial velocity is  u . Thus, after a time interval  t  − t e  the pieces lie on a circle with radius  u ( t  − t e )  centered around the origin of the moving center of mass frame. To see what shape they make when they land on the ground, we need to convert to the stationary frame of the ground. To do so, we use equations (8) and (9) and the formulas to convert between references frames to write ⃗ v i ( t ) =   ⃗ V CM ( t ) +  u ˆ r i (10) ⃗ r i ( t ) =   ⃗ R CM ( t ) +  u ( t  − t e )ˆ r i , (11) where  ⃗ v i ( t )  and  ⃗ r i ( t )  are the horizontal velocity and position of the  i th   fragment in the ground reference frame,   ⃗ V CM ( t )  and   ⃗ R CM ( t )  are the horizontal velocity and position of the origin of the center of mass frame, and  ˆ r i  is the radial unit vector pointing at the  i th   fragment from the origin of the center of mass frame. Due to the fact that there is no net external horizontal force on the system, the horizontal momentum of the projectile does not change. Thus,   ⃗ V CM ( t )  is a constant and equal to its initial value when the projectile is launched   ⃗ V CM ( t ) =  v 0  cos  α ˆ x . This implies that the center of mass position is   ⃗ R CM ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  α ˆ x  because the center of mass position at  t  = 0  is at the origin in the ground reference frame (i.e. the integration constant that arises in going from velocity to position is zero). Plugging this result into equation (11), we see that ⃗ r i ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  α ˆ x  +  u ( t  − t e )ˆ r i (12) 4 Work and energy - 8 at any time  t > t e . The last term tell us that, in the center of mass reference frame, all the pieces are flying apart outwards from each other with the same speed  u , but in different directions  ˆ r i . Thus, they form a circle of radius R ( t ) =  u ( t  − t e ) . (13) The first term on the right side of equation (12) tells us how this motion changes when we convert to the reference frame of the ground. Since the subscript  i  doesn’t appear, we know that this term is the same for all fragments. Specifically, all fragments are moving together in the  ˆ x  direction with time. This corresponds to a displacement in the center of the circle by ⃗ d ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  α ˆ x. (14) However, since all pieces are moving together, it doesn’t change the shape from being circular. In conclusion, in the reference frame of the ground the pieces form a circle that shifts in the  ˆ x  direction with time. What is the distance between the center of the circle and the cannon? This can be found by taking the magnitude of equation (14) at the time when the fragments hit the ground  t  =  t g  using equation (7), giving d ( t g ) = 2 v 2 0 g   sin  α  cos  α. (15) This is the same location that the projectile would have hit had it not exploded. Calculate the speed  u  and then the radius of the circle. To calculate  u  it is most convienant to return the reference frame moving with the horizontal location of the center of mass of the system. Just before the explosion the total kinetic energy of the system is zero as there is no vertical motion and we are in a reference frame moving with the horizontal motion of the projectile. From the problem statement, we know that just after the explosion the kinetic energy of the system increases by  W . This must be contained in the speed  u  possessed by each of the 1000 fragments. Using this we can calculate  u  to be W  = 1000 X i =1 K i  = 1000 X i =1 1 2 m i u 2  = 1 2 u 2 1000 X i =1 m i  =  1 2 u 2 M ⇒ u  = r 2 W M  . (16) To find the radius of the circle we evaluate equation (13) at the time when the fragments hit the ground t  =  t g  and substitute equations (3), (7), and (16). This gives R ( t g ) = r 2 W M v 0 g   sin  α. (17) 3. If a fragment hits the cannon, then we know the radius of the circle must be equal to the distance between the cannon and the center of the circle at  t  =  t g , R ( t g ) =  d ( t g ) . (18) Substituting equations (15) and (17) gives r 2 W M v 0 g   sin  α  = 2 v 2 0 g   sin  α  cos  α ⇒ W  = 2 Mv 2 0   cos 2  α ⇒ W  = 4 K 0  cos 2   α (19) as the initial kinetic energy of the projectile is  K 0  =  Mv 2 0 / 2 . 5 Work and energy - 8 ', 'course': 'Physique meca'}, {'question': 'Most mobile e-banking applications use certificate pinning to validate the certificates of the servers\\n they connect to.\\n • Describe an attack that can be prevented by using a pinned certificate.\\n ', 'answer': 'Without certificate pinning, the client has to trust a list of known trusted root certification au-\\n thorities (CAs) when connecting to a server.

What is this maximum distance? 2. Considering that the attacking player kicks the ball as described in part 1. How far should the defense be placed (from the opposing player) to counter her shot? The height of the defensive player’s hand in the air is  h . ', 'answer': 'As indicated in the title, this problem is challenging. We start by defining the coordinate system such that y  is upwards in the vertical direction and  x  is in the horizontal direction of the initial velocity of the ball. The origin is located at the position where the ball is kicked. We will denote the initial speed of the ball by  v bi , which we know must be less than  v max bi . Using our general solution for projectile motion along with the initial position ( x 0  = 0  and  y 0  = 0 ) and velocity ( v x 0  =  v bi  cos  α  and  v y 0  =  v bi  sin  α ), we can write the equations of motion for the ball as ⃗ a b ( t ) =  − g ˆ y (7) ⃗ v b ( t ) =  v x 0 ˆ x  + ( − gt  +  v y 0 ) ˆ y  =  v bi  cos  α ˆ x  + ( − gt  +  v bi  sin  α ) ˆ y (8) ⃗ r b ( t ) = ( v x 0 t  +  x 0 ) ˆ x  + \\x10 − g 2 t 2  +  v y 0 t  +  y 0 \\x11 ˆ y  =  v bi t  cos  α ˆ x  + \\x10 − g 2 t 2  +  v bi t  sin  α \\x11 ˆ y. (9) 1. We want to find the distance at which the player catches the ball. To do so, we must first find the time at which the ball returns to the ground, which we will call  t 1 . The condition for the ball returning to the ground is  y b ( t 1 ) = 0 , so we can substitute the  ˆ y  component of equation (9) to find y b ( t 1 ) = 0 =  − g 2 t 2 1   +  v bi t 1   sin  α. (10) This equation has two solutions,  t 1  = 0  and t 1  =  2 v bi g sin  α. (11) The first solution corresponds to the time of the kick and the second corresponds to the catch, so the second solution is what we’re looking for. By substituting this time into the equation for the horizontal position of the ball from equation (9), we can find the distance at which the ball lands to be x b ( t 1 ) =  v bi t 1  cos  α  =  2 v 2 bi g sin  α  cos  α. (12) Now we must analyze the player’s motion. Since she runs at a constant velocity (that we will call  v p ) and her initial position is at the origin, her position is given by x p ( t ) =  v p t. (13) Thus, at time  t  =  t 1  her position is x p ( t 1 ) =  v p t 1  =  2 v bi v p g sin  α, (14) where we have made use of equation (11). The ball and the player must be at the same location for a catch to occur, which we will call  ℓ = x b ( t 1 ) =  x p ( t 1 ) . Thus, we require equations (12) and (14) to be equal, which allows us to determine the initial angle of the ball v bi  cos  α  =  v p ⇒ cos  α  =   v p v bi ⇒ α  = arccos \\x12  v p v bi \\x13 . (15) To use this information to find a simple expression for  ℓ , we can draw the triangle implied by this equation (shown below). After using the Pythagorean theorem to find that the length of the missing v p v bi α side is q v 2 bi   − v 2 p , we see that sin  α  = q v 2 bi   − v 2 p v bi . (16) Substituting this result into equation (14) (or equation (12)) gives ℓ =  2 g  v p q v 2 bi   − v 2 p . (17) This is the expression for the distance at which the ball lands, which we want to maximize. To do so, we can immediately see that we want to increase the initial velocity of the ball as much as possible by setting v bi  =  v max bi . (18) This is also intuitively obvious. The harder you kick the ball, the more time it will be in the air and the more time the player will have to run. The dependence on  v p  is more complicated. We see that increasing it will increase the multiplying factor in front of the square root (thereby increasing  ℓ ), but it will also decrease the quantity in the square root (thereby decreasing  ℓ ). To find the maximum, we can remember our past analysis of projectile motion. The maximum vertical position occurred where the vertical velocity (which is the derivative of the vertical position) went to zero. This is a general technique to find the extrema (i.e. both maxima and minima) of functions: calculate the derivative and solve for the locations at which it is zero. Thus, we take equation (17) and calculate dℓ dv p = 0 =  2 g q v 2 bi   − v 2 p   + 2 g  v p \\uf8eb \\uf8ed 1 2 − 2 v p q v 2 bi   − v 2 p \\uf8f6 \\uf8f8 =  2 g q v 2 bi   − v 2 p   − 2 g v 2 p q v 2 bi   − v 2 p = 2 g q v 2 bi   − v 2 p \\x00 v 2 bi   − 2 v 2 p \\x01 (19) using the chain rule and product rules. Simplifying this expression, we find that there is only one extrema and it occurs at v p  =   v bi √ 2 . (20) Substituting this result into equation (17) and comparing with any other choice of  v p  (e.g.  v p  = 0 ), we can verify that this extrema is, in fact, a maxima (as opposed to a minima). Thus, this is the optimal speed that the player would ideally run at. If this isn’t possible because  v p  =  v bi / √ 2  > v max p , the player should run as close as possible to this value, namely at their maximum speed of  v max p . Therefore, we have to explicitly distinguish these two possibilities by writing v p  = \\x1a v max p if  v bi / √ 2  > v max p v bi / √ 2 otherwise   . (21) Combining equations (17), (18), and (21), we find that the maximum distance to catch the ball is ℓ = ( (2 v max p /g ) q ( v max bi ) 2   − ( v max p ) 2 if  v max bi / √ 2  > v max p ( v max bi ) 2 /g otherwise . (22) Combining equations (15), (18), and (21), we find that ideal angle to kick the ball is α  = \\x1a arccos \\x00 v max p /v max bi \\x01 if  v max bi / √ 2  > v max p arccos \\x00 1 / √ 2 \\x01 =  π/ 4 = 45 ◦ otherwise . (23) The interpretation of these results is that if you are sufficiently fast (i.e.  v max p is sufficiently large), the second case in all three equations applies. In this case, you want to kick the ball at  α  = 45 ◦ , as this is the angle that maximizes the distance traveled by the ball, and run below your maximum speed, such that you arrive at the same time and place as the ball when it lands. However, the more realistic case is the first, that you can out-kick your running speed. In this case you want to run at your maximum speed and angle your kick higher (i.e.  α >  45 ◦ ) so that the ball stays in the air for longer and you have more time to run. 2. The position of the ball is given by equation (9). Using equations (15) and (16), we can write equation (9) as ⃗ r b ( t ) =  v p t ˆ x  + \\x10 − g 2 t 2  +  t q v 2 bi   − v 2 p \\x11 ˆ y. Solving the  x  component of this equation (i.e.  x b ( t ) =  v p t ) for time gives  t  =  x b /v p , which we can substitute into the  y  component to find y b ( x b ) =  − g 2 \\x12 x b v p \\x13 2 +   x b v p q v 2 bi   − v 2 p   =  − g 2 v 2 p x 2 b   +  x b s v 2 bi v 2 p − 1 . This is the trajectory of the ball. To find where the defense should be placed, we need to determine at what  x  position the height of the ball is equal to that of the defense player’s hand. Therefore, we set y b ( x b ) =  h  to find h  =  − g 2 v 2 p x 2 b   +  x b s v 2 bi v 2 p − 1 ⇒ 0 = g 2 v 2 p x 2 b   − x b s v 2 bi v 2 p − 1 +  h, which we want to solve for  x b . This is a quadratic equation, which we can solve by first computing the discriminant ∆=   v 2 bi v 2 p − 1  − 4   gh 2 v 2 p =   v 2 bi   − v 2 p   − 2 gh v 2 p and then the solution x b  =   v p g \\x10q v 2 bi   − v 2 p   ± q v 2 bi   − v 2 p   − 2 gh \\x11 . We see there are 2 solutions — the shorter distance corresponds to the defense player catching the ball on its way up, and the longer distance corresponds to catching it on the way down. We arrive at the final answer by substituting equations (18) and (21) into the longer distance to get x b  = ( ( v max p /g ) \\x10q ( v max bi ) 2   − ( v max p ) 2   + q ( v max bi ) 2   − ( v max p ) 2   − 2 gh \\x11 if  v max bi / √ 2  > v max p ( v max bi / (2 g )) \\x00p ( v max bi ) 2   + p ( v max bi ) 2   − 4 gh \\x01 otherwise .

After that we can apply the average pooling from the question statement and get that the receptive field won’t increase. So there is a network, where we apply an average 2x2 pooling and the receptive field doesn’t increase, so I think the answer to the question should be False.

Another consideration is for paging. Larger pages demand more I/O (disk) bandwidth when paging-out or paging-in. On the other side, choosing a too small granularity will results in large number of pages for the same memory footprint which means more page-table entries and, thus, larger page tables.

', 'course': 'ML'}, {'question': 'Two balls of mass  m 1  and  m 2  are released with no initial velocity from a height  h  as shown below. Ball 1 is directly beneath ball 2 and they are touching. During their fall, the balls stay in contact until they hit the ground. The situation can be described as an elastic collision between ball 1 and the ground, immediately followed by a collision between the two balls. Note that you can assume the radii of the balls are negligibly small, as is air drag. The collision between the two balls is perfectly elastic. What are the velocities of each ball immediately after the second collision? ', 'answer': 'Projectile motion of the descent:  Before the first collision, both balls experience projectile motion. By conservation of mechanical energy during the entire fall, we have 0 +  m 1 gh  =   m1/ 2  * v1f^2   + 0 and 0 +  m 2 gh  =   m 2 / 2 * v2f^2   + 0 , (1) where we will define  y  = 0  to be the ground and let  ˆ y  point upwards (as shown in the problem statement). Solving both these equations for the velocity just before impact with the ground v1f  =  v2f  =  ± p 2 gh  =  − p 2 gh  =  − v ⇒ v  = p 2 gh (2) reveals that it is the same for both balls (which is expected as we know that objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass). We chose the negative sign as we know that both balls are falling downwards in the  − ˆ y  direction. Additionally, we chose to define a new parameter  v  such that it is positive. Collision between ball 1 and the ground:  Next, ball 1 experiences an elastic collision with the ground. We have the intuition that the ball will maintain its speed and reverse its direction as a result of the collision, but this can be demonstrated rigorously. We start by writing requiring conservation of momentum m 1 v 1 i  +  M E v Ei  =  m 1 v 1 f  +  M E v Ef , (3) where the subscript  E  refers to the earth. We know that  v Ei  = 0  (given that we have taken a laboratory reference frame) and the velocity of ball 1 just before the collision is equal to its final velocity after projectile motion (i.e. equation (2)). Thus, we can find − m 1 v  + 0 =  m 1 v 1 f  +  M E v Ef ⇒ v Ef  =  − m 1 M E ( v  +  v 1 f )  . (4) Since the collision is elastic, we can also enforce conservation of mechanical energy m 1/ 2 *  v2  + 0 =  m 1 ^/2 *v1f^2   +  M E/ 2  * vEf^2 . (5) Substituting equation (4) shows that m 1 2   v 2  =  m 1 2   v 2 1 f   +  M E 2 \\x12  m 1 M E ( v  +  v 1 f ) \\x13 2 ⇒ m 1 2 \\x00 v 2   − v 2 1 f \\x01 =   m 1 M E m 1 2  ( v  +  v 1 f ) 2  . (6) Crucially, we see that the right-hand side of the equation has a factor of  m 1 /M E , while the left-hand side does not. Since the earth is  much  more massive than the ball, we know that  m 1 /M E  ≪ 1  and we can neglect the right-hand side of the equation. Thus, we find that ball 1 has a velocity of m 1 2 \\x00 v 2   − v 2 1 f \\x01 = 0 ⇒ v 2 1 f   =  v 2  = 2 gh ⇒ v 1 f  =  ± p 2 gh  = p 2 gh  =  v (7) after colliding with the ground, where we’ve used equation (2) and chosen the plus sign (as the ball must change direction to avoid passing through the earth). Thus, we’ve found that, before the two balls collide, ball 1 has a velocity of  v  =   √ 2 gh , while ball 2 still has a velocity of  − v  =  − √ 2 gh . Collision between ball 1 and ball 2:  Now the two balls collide elastically with one another. In class, we derived the general formulas for the velocities that result from an elastic collision between two 3 objects in one dimension. This derivation was streamlined to minimize the math, but was not intuitive. You are free to simply use the formulas we found. Here we present a more intuitive derivation that, as a result, is considerably more messy (even for the case considered here of identical initial speeds). Enforcing conservation of momentum and using the final velocities from the previous part gives m 1 v 1 i  + m 2 v 2 i  =  m 1 v 1 f  + m 2 v 2 f ⇒ m 1 v  − m 2 v  =  m 1 v 1 f  + m 2 v 2 f ⇒ v 1 f  =   m 1  − m 2 m 1 v  − m 2 m 1 v 2 f .

To sketch the plot, we first consider the tortoise. It has a constant velocity throughout the entire race. A constant velocity corresponds to a position that is linear with time, so we can draw a straight line between the points  ( t  =  t 0 , x  = 0)  and  ( t  =  t 2 , x  =  L ) . The trajectory of the hare is a bit more complicated. The hare starts at a constant velocity that is slower than that of the tortoise and maintains the constant velocity until  t  =  t 1 .

The roll of paper is free to rotate around a massless internal plastic cylinder of radius  r . This plastic cylinder is suspended from the wall by two metal rods, which both make an angle  θ  with the wall. While you may ignore the friction between the internal plastic cylinder and the paper roll, the friction at the point of contact  C  between the roll and the wall is  not  negligible. It is characterized by a coefficient of static friction  µ s  and a coefficient of kinetic friction  µ c , which satisfy 1 2 tan  θ  > µ s  > µ c . We will model someone pulling on the toilet paper as applying a known constant vertical force   ⃗ F a  =  F a ˆ j at the outer edge of the roll (i.e. point  A ). The roll starts off at rest. We will assume that the paper is sufficiently thin that the radius  R , mass  M , and moment of inertia  I G  remain constant as it is unrolled vertically to dispense several squares of toilet paper.

', 'answer': 'The free body diagram for the books on their own is shown below, where we have the normal force of the table on the books   ⃗ N b , the static friction force from the table on the books   ⃗ f s , and the weight of the books m⃗ g . There is no motion in the  ˆ y  direction, so Newton’s second law tells use that the weight is balanced by the normal force  N b  according to N b  − mg  = 0 ⇒ N b  =  mg. (4) The only horizontal force on the books is the static friction force  f s , which is equal to its maximum value of  f s  =  µ s N b  when Carl is applying the maximum force for which the books do not slide. By applying Newton’s second law in the  ˆ x  direction, we find X F  =  ma ⇒ f s  =  ma ⇒ µ s N b  =  ma ⇒ a  =   µ s N b m  . Therefore, using equation (4) we see that the acceleration is a  =  µ s g. (5) Now consider the table, whose free body diagram is shown below and includes a lot of forces. There is the normal force from the ground   ⃗ N T  , the force applied by Carl   ⃗ F , the kinetic friction force from the floor   ⃗ f d , the weight  m⃗ g , the normal force from the books on the table  − ⃗ N b , and the static friction force from the books  − ⃗ f s . Note that the static friction force on the table is an action-reaction pair with the static friction force in the free body diagram for the books, so it must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Similarly the normal force from the books on the table is an action-reaction pair with the normal force in the free body diagram for the books. In order to avoid sliding, the table and books must accelerate identically. The kinetic friction force   ⃗ f d between the table and the floor has a magnitude of  f d  =  µ d N T  . Since the table does not accelerate in the  ˆ y  direction, Newton’s second law gives N T  − N b  − Mg  = 0 ⇒ N T  =  N b  +  Mg  = ( m  +  M )  g, (6) where we have used equation (4). In the  ˆ x  direction, Newton’s second law for the table is F  − f d  − f s  =  Ma. By substituting equations (4) through (6) and the forms of the friction forces (i.e.  f s  =  µ s N b  and  f d  =  µ d N T  ) from above, we obtain F  − µ d N T  − µ s N b  =  Mµ s g ⇒ F  − µ d  ( m  +  M )  g  − µ s mg  =  Mµ s g.

The motion of any rigid body can be represented as the motion of the center of mass, plus a rotation about the center of mass. In problem set 6, we found the position of the center of mass after the collision to be ⃗ R CM ( t ) =   V 0 2   t ˆ x  +   ℓ 4  ˆ y. (1) However, to completely specify the motion of the particle-rod system, we must also calculate the angular velocity of rotation of the system  about its center of mass . To calculate the rotation after the collision from the information just before the collision, we will use conservation of angular momentum about the center of mass (as there are no external torques acting on the particle-rod system). This is expressed as ⃗ L b  =   ⃗ L a . (2) where the subscript “b” indicates that the quantity is evaluated just before the collision and the subscript “a” indicates just after. Just before the collision, the angular momentum of the system about the center of mass is the sum of the angular momenta of all the objects  i  in the system. This is ⃗ L b  = X i ⃗ L ib  = X i ⃗ r ib  ×  m i ⃗ v ib  =  ⃗ r pb  ×  M⃗ v pb , (3) where the subscript “p” indicates the particle. Note that there is no contribution to the angular momentum from the rod as it is completely stationary before the collision. From inspecting the problem statement we see that, just before the collision, the particle is moving with  ⃗ v pb  =  V 0 ˆ x  at a position  ⃗ r pb  =  − ( ℓ/ 4)ˆ y  relative to the center of mass of the particle-rod system at  t  = 0 . Substituting these values, equation (3) becomes ⃗ L b  =   M 4   ℓV 0 ˆ z. (4) After the collision, the rod and particle form a combined object that rotates at a common angular velocity  ⃗ ω  about its center of mass. The angular momentum of such an rotating extended object is ⃗ L a  =  I CM ⃗ ω, (5) where  I CM  is the momentum of inertia of the particle-rod system about its center of mass. Substituting this and equation (4) into equation (2) allows us to find ⃗ ω  = M 4 I CM ℓV 0 ˆ z. (6) This is almost the final solution, but we don’t yet know  I CM . To calculate it, we start from the definition of the center of mass I CM  = Z M ρ 2 dm, (7) where the integral is taken over the entire mass of the combined object. Because integrals are just summations of infinitesimally small differential elements, we can separate it into the contributions from the two objects I CM  = Z rod ρ 2 dm  + Z particle ρ 2 dm  =  I rod  +  I particle . (8) 4 Angular momentum - 12 Since the particle is well represented by a point mass, all of its mass is located at the same distance ρ  =  ℓ/ 4  from the center of mass. Thus, I particle  = Z particle ρ 2 dm  = Z particle \\x12  ℓ 4 \\x13 2 dm  =   ℓ 2 16 Z particle dm  =  1 16 Mℓ 2 . (9) There are two ways to find the contribution to the moment of inertia from the rod. This first is simpler and uses the parallel axis theorem. From the table of moments of inertia presented in lecture, we know that a uniform thin rod rotated about its center of mass (i.e. its geometric center) has a moment of inertia of  I center rod =  Mℓ 2 / 12 . However, we are interested in the rotation of the rod about the center of mass of the particle-rod system, not the center of mass of the rod alone. From equation (1), we see that the center of mass of the rod (which is at  ( ℓ/ 2)ˆ y ) is a distance of  h  =  ℓ/ 4  away from the center of mass of the particle-rod system at  t  = 0 . Thus, we will use the parallel axis theorem to see that I rod  =  I center rod +  Mh 2   =  1 12 Mℓ 2  + 1 16 Mℓ 2  = 7 48 Mℓ 2 . (10) The second way to find the moment of inertia of the rod is to directly evaluate the integral in equation (8). This approach is more challenging, but applies to a wider variety of situations. To convert from an integral over mass to an integral in space, we use the linear mass density  λ  =  dm/dρ  and the fact that the density is uniform  λ  =  M/ℓ to see that  dm  = ( M/ℓ ) dρ . Substituting this we see that I rod  = Z rod ρ 2 dm  =   M ℓ Z rod ρ 2 dρ. (11) To determine the bounds of the integral, we must think about the geometry of the problem. Here  ρ represents the distance from the center of mass of the particle-rod system, which is at  y  =  ℓ/ 4 . Thus, to integrate over the full object we must consider the part of the rod above and below the center of mass, which is tricky as some of these points have the same value of  ρ . This can be handled by splitting the integral into the contributions above and below, which are given by I rod  =   M ℓ Z  3 ℓ/ 4 0 ρ 2 dρ  +   M ℓ Z  ℓ/ 4 0 ρ 2 dρ. (12) respectively. Evaluting the integrals is straightforward and yields I rod  =   M ℓ \\x12 ρ 3 3 \\x15 ρ =3 ℓ/ 4 ρ =0 +   M ℓ \\x12 ρ 3 3 \\x15 ρ = ℓ/ 4 ρ =0 =   M 3 ℓ \\x12 3 4 ℓ \\x13 3 +   M 3 ℓ \\x12 1 4 ℓ \\x13 3 =  1 3 \\x12 27 64  + 1 64 \\x13 Mℓ 2   =  7 48 Mℓ 2 , (13) which is identical to the solution using the parallel axis theorem (i.e. equation (10)). Substituting equation (9) and (13) into equation (8) gives the total moment of inertia of the particle-rod system around its center of mass, which is I CM  =  7 48 Mℓ 2  + 1 16 Mℓ 2  = 5 24 Mℓ 2 . (14) Substituting this into equation (6) gives the final answer of ⃗ ω  =  6 5 V 0 ℓ ˆ z. (15) Importantly, since there are no additional forces acting at later times, we have conservation of angular momentum. Thus, the angular velocity of the particle-rod system remains the same at all times  t  ≥ 0 . 5 Angular momentum - 12 2. We know that the particle-rod system moves based on the combination of two types of motion. Its center of mass translates, which has been calculated in equation (1). Additionally, in the center of mass reference frame, all points in the system rotate about the center of mass with a constant angular velocity  ⃗ ω  = (6 / 5)( V 0 /ℓ )ˆ z . This rotation is uniform circular motion, so the angular velocity corresponds to a velocity of ⃗ v  =  ⃗ ω  ×  ⃗ ρ  =  ω ˆ z  ×  ρ ˆ ρ  =  ρω   ˆ ϕ. (16) We are asked about the position of the particle, which is located at a distance  ρ  =  ℓ/ 4  away from the center of mass. Thus, it has a velocity of ⃗ v  =   ℓ 4 ω  ˆ ϕ (17) after the collision. Note that if we substitute the value for  ω , we find  ⃗ v  = (6 / 20) V 0   ˆ ϕ , which shows that the particle is slowed down substantially as a result of the collision. Ultimately, we want to express the position in Cartesian coordinates, so we will convert the cylindrical unit vector   ˆ ϕ  according to ⃗ v  =   ℓ 4 ω  ( − sin  ϕ ˆ x  + cos  ϕ ˆ y )  . (18) Given that  ω  is constant, we can integrate the definition of the angular speed   ˙ ϕ  =  ω  to find ϕ ( t ) =  ωt  +  C, (19) where  C  is an integration constant. Since  ϕ  is the angle from the  + x -axis and increases towards the + y -axis, at  t  = 0  the particle is at  ϕ (0) =  − π/ 2 . Using this initial condition, we find that  C  =  − π/ 2 . Substituting this and equation (19) into equation (18) gives ⃗ v ( t ) =   ℓ 4 ω \\x10 − sin \\x10 ωt  − π 2 \\x11 ˆ x  + cos \\x10 ωt  − π 2 \\x11 ˆ y \\x11 =   ℓ 4 ω  (cos ( ωt ) ˆ x  + sin ( ωt ) ˆ y )  , (20) where in the second step we have used trigonometric identities that one can find in a table. This result is consistent with our intuition – the bottom of the rod should start rotating to the right, in the same direction the particle strikes it. To find the position, we simply integrate equation (20) to find ⃗ r ( t ) =   ℓ 4  (sin ( ωt ) ˆ x  − cos ( ωt ) ˆ y )  . (21) However, we must remember that the position  ⃗ r ( t )  is in the reference frame moving with the center of mass of the particle-rod system. Thus, we must change back to the reference frame given in the problem statement using   ⃗ R p ( t ) =   ⃗ R CM ( t ) +  ⃗ r ( t ) . This yields the final answer of ⃗ R p ( t ) =   ⃗ R CM ( t ) +   ℓ 4  (sin( ωt )ˆ x  − cos( ωt )ˆ y )  .

Express your answer in terms of  m s ,  m p ,  G ,  v f , and  r f  as needed. 2. If the satellite were in a circular orbit of radius  r 0  =  r c , would its speed  v 0  be greater than, equal to, or less than the speed  v c  in the original elliptic orbit? 3 ', 'answer': '1. As in problem 1, the motion of the satellite will conserve both angular momentum and mechanical energy according to ⃗ L f  =   ⃗ L c (1) E mf  =  E mc . (2) We will choose to evaluate angular momentum about the center of the planet and take the reference point for the gravitational potential energy to be infinitely far away. Thus, conservation of angular momentum and mechanical energy become ⃗ r f  ×  m s ⃗ v f  =  ⃗ r c  ×  m s ⃗ v c (3) K f  +  U Gf  =  K c  +  U Gc (4) respectively.

(6) Substituting equation (5) into equation (6) gives 2 Gm p r f v c v f − 2 Gm p r f =  v 2 c   − v 2 f ⇒ 2 Gm p r f v f ( v c  − v f ) = ( v c  +  v f ) ( v c  − v f ) ⇒ v c  =  2 Gm p r f v f − v f .  (7) We can plug this into equation (5) to find r c  = v f 2 Gm p r f  v f   − v f r f  =  r f   2 Gm p r f v 2 f − 1 ! − 1 . (8) 2. Since the satellite is not burning any fuel, the gravitational attraction to the planet must be causing the centripetal acceleration enabling the uniform circular motion. This condition is expressed through Newton’s second law for the satellite as ⃗ F G  =  m s ⃗ a cent . (9) The centripetal acceleration is given by  ⃗ a cent  =  − r 0 ω 2 ˆ r  =  − r 0 ( v 0 /r 0 ) 2 ˆ r  =  − ( v 2 0 /r 0 )ˆ r , where  ω  is the angular speed of the satellite. Substituting this and the form of the gravitational force into equation (9) gives − Gm s m p r 2 0 ˆ r  =  − m s v 2 0 r 0 ˆ r ⇒ Gm p r 0 =  v 2 0 ⇒ v 0  = r Gm p r 0 . (10) This solution can be checked by taking the circular case in our solution to part 1. If we let  r f  =  r c  =  r 0 , v f  =  v c  =  v 0 , and substitute equation (10), we find that both equations (7) and (8) are satisfied. Now let’s compare  v 0  with  v c , given that  r 0  =  r c . Even though we have a solution for both, given by equations (7) and (10), this turns out to be surprisingly tricky. To make the comparison easier, we want to eliminate the velocity  v f  from equation (7). Thus, we rearrange equation (5) to find v f  =   r c r f v c . (11) 11 Angular momentum - 12 We substitute this into equation (7) to get v c  =  2 Gm p r c v c − r c r f v c ⇒ v 2 c   = 2 Gm p r c − r c r f v 2 c ⇒ \\x12 r f  +  r c r f \\x13 v 2 c   = 2 Gm p r c ⇒ v c  = r Gm p r c s 2 r f r f  +  r c . (12) We can now evaluate equation (10) at  r 0  =  r c  to get v 0  = r Gm p r c (13) and compare with equation (12). Since  r c  < r f , we know that p 2 r f / ( r f  +  r c )  >  1 .

Next, we’ll decompose the rods into differential elements of mass  ∆ m  and consider the element located a distance  x  from the origin. Since the rod is uniform, the linear mass density is λ  =   M L (1) as well as λ  =  ∆ m ∆ x  , (2) where  ∆ x  is the length of the differential element. Taking the limit of equation (2) as  ∆ x  → 0  gives λ  =   dm dx  . (3) The center of mass for a continuous system is defined by ⃗ R CM  = R M   ⃗ rdm R M   dm , (4) where R M ( . . . ) dm  indicates an integral over the entire mass distribution of the whole object. We can perform a change of variables from mass to position to find ⃗ R CM  = R  L 0   ⃗ r   dm dx   dx R  L 0 dm dx   dx , (5) where R  L 0   ( . . . ) dx  indicates an integral over the entire length of the object.

We will use the same coordinate system as in part 1 and again consider a differential mass element ∆ m  located a distance  x  from the origin. The linear mass density  λ ( x )  is no longer uniform along the length of the rod, so  λ  ̸ =  M/L  at every point. However, the definition of the local linear mass density is λ ( x ) = lim ∆ x → 0 ∆ m ∆ x  , (7) where  ∆ x  is the length of the differential element. Since the right side is the definition of the derivative, we have λ ( x ) =   dm dx  . (8) Substituting the functional form of the density from the problem statement gives dm dx   =  λ 0 x L .

At time  t 0 ,  m 1  has a velocity of magnitude  v 0  directed towards  m 2 , which is at rest a distance  d  away. At time  t 1 , the particles collide. Calculate  L , the distance traveled by particle 1 during the time interval  t 1  − t 0 .  Express your answer using some or all of the following variables:  m 1 ,  m 2 ,  t 0 ,  t 1 , v 0 , and  d . ', 'answer': 'We will start by choosing a coordinate system with the origin defined to be the location of  m 1  at  t  =  t 0 . This choice is sensible as we will then know that L  =  x 1 ( t 1 ) , (1) i.e. the position of  m 1  will be identical to the distance traveled since  t  =  t 0  (which is what the problem asks us to calculate). Additionally we note that the problem is one-dimensional, so we will only need to consider the  ˆ x  direction. Since there is no external force on the two-particle system, we know that the acceleration of the center of mass is zero, regardless of the force between the objects. Thus, we know that the center of mass velocity is constant in time V CM ( t ) = P N i =1   m i v i P N i =1   m i =   m 1 v 1 ( t ) +  m 2 v 2 ( t ) m 1  +  m 2 =  V CM ( t 0 ) (2) and, thus, doesn’t change from its value at  t  =  t 0 . This is significant because the problem statement gives us information about the system at  t  =  t 0 . Since the center of mass velocity is constant, we know that the center of mass position is linear in time. We can write it as X CM ( t ) = P N i =1   m i x i P N i =1   m i =   m 1 x 1 ( t ) +  m 2 x 2 ( t ) m 1  +  m 2 =  V CM ( t 0 )( t  − t 0 ) +  X CM ( t 0 ) , (3) where we have chosen the form of our linear function to depend only on quantities at  t  =  t 0 , again because that is the time that the problem statement gives us information about. To determine the center of mass velocity at  t  =  t 0 , we substitute the facts from the problem statement that v 1 ( t 0 ) =  v 0  and  v 2 ( t 0 ) = 0  into equation (2) to find V CM ( t 0 ) =   m 1 v 0  +  m 2 (0) m 1  +  m 2 = m 1 m 1  +  m 2 v 0 . (4) To determine the center of mass position at  t  =  t 0 , we substitute the facts from the problem statement that x 1 ( t 0 ) = 0  (due to the definition of our origin) and  x 2 ( t 0 ) =  d  into equation (3) to find X CM ( t 0 ) =   m 1 (0) +  m 2 d m 1  +  m 2 =  V CM ( t 0 )( t 0  − t 0 ) +  X CM ( t 0 ) ⇒ X CM ( t 0 ) = m 2 m 1  +  m 2 d. (5) Thus, substituting equations (4) and (5) into (3), we find the center of mass position as a function of time to be X CM ( t ) = m 1 m 1  +  m 2 v 0 ( t  − t 0 ) + m 2 m 1  +  m 2 d. (6) The final crucial insight is to recognize that the center of mass position at  t  =  t 1  is position of the collision. Since the particles are colliding (and are small), both particles are at the same location, which also must be the center of mass. Thus, we have x 1 ( t 1 ) =  x 2 ( t 1 ) =  X CM ( t 1 ) . (7) Evaluating equation (6) at  t  =  t 1  and combining it with equations (1) and (7) gives the final answer X CM ( t 1 ) =  L  = m 1 m 1  +  m 2 v 0  ( t 1  − t 0 ) + m 2 m 1  +  m 2 d  =   m 1 v 0  ( t 1  − t 0 ) +  m 2 d m 1  +  m 2 . (8) Note that we never needed to use the form of the force between the objects. It was enough to know that there was no external force on the two particles and that they eventually collide.

Here the top coin is denoted by the  t  subscript, the bottom coin by  b , and the turntable by  g . R ω ρ z ϕ Top coin N bt f bt mg Bottom coin N gb f tb mg N tb f gb To determine the magnitude of the radial force exerted by the turntable on the bottom coin   ⃗ f gb , we will apply Newton’s second law to each coin. A key point is that the static friction between the coins form an action-reaction pair, so the static friction that makes the top coin accelerate inward also acts to push the bottom coin radially outward. The radial component of Newton’s second law for the bottom coin is f tb  − f gb  =  − mRω 2 , (1) where we’ve used that the centripetal acceleration is  ⃗ a  =  − Rω 2 ˆ ρ . The radial component of Newton’s second law on the top coin is given by − f bt  =  − mRω 2 ⇒ f bt  =  mRω 2 . (2) Since the static friction force of the bottom coin on the top coin  f bt  and the static friction force of the top coin on the bottom coin  f tb  are an action-reaction pair, Newton’s third law requires that their magnitudes respect  f bt  =  f tb . Substituting this into equation (2) gives f tb  =  mRω 2 . (3)   Then substituting equation (3) into equation (1) yields mRω 2   − f gb  =  − mRω 2 . (4) Hence the turntable exerts a inward radial force on the bottom coin with a magnitude of f gb  = 2 mRω 2 . (5) Comparing with equation (2), we see that the static friction force on the bottom coin from the turntable is twice as large as the static friction force on the top coin. 2. When two surfaces slip, it is because the static friction force required to hold them in place has exceeded its maximum possible strength of  f   max   =  µN . To calculate this, we must first find the magnitude of the normal force  N  between the relevant surfaces. Applying Newton’s second law to the top coin in the vertical  ˆ z  direction yields N bt  − mg  = 0 , (6) where we note that none of the objects in this problem are accelerating vertically so  a z  = 0 . Thus, we can calculate the normal force of the bottom coin on the top coin to be N bt  =  mg. (7) Since this force forms an action-reaction pair with the normal force of the top coin on the bottom coin, we know that their magnitudes follow  N tb  =  N bt  =  mg . Substituting equation (7) into the form of the static friction force, we see that the top coin will slip when the static friction between the two coins reaches its maximum value of f   max bt =  µ 2 N bt  =  µ 2 mg. (8) We then substitute this result into equation (2) to find µ 2 mg  =  mR  ( ω max t ) 2   , (9) where  ω max t is the maximum angular speed for which the top coin does not slip. Rearranging this, we find ω max t = r µ 2 g R  . (10) Newton’s second law for the bottom coin in the  ˆ z  direction is N gb  − N tb  − mg  = 0 . (11) Noting again from Newton’s third law that  N tb  =  N bt  =  mg , we can rearrange this equation to show that the normal force between the turntable and the bottom coin is N gb  = 2 mg. (12) Using this and the form of the static friction force, we see that the bottom coin will slip when the static friction between it and the turntable exceeds f   max gb =  µN gb  = 2 µ 1 mg. (13) From equation (5), we can determine that the maximum angular speed after which the bottom coin slips will satisfy 2 µ 1 mg  = 2 mR  ( ω max b ) 2   . (14)   Rearranging we find that ω max b = r µ 1 g R  . (15) Comparing equations (10) and (15) and remembering that  µ 2  < µ 1 , we see that ω max t < ω max b . (16) Thus, as we increase the angular velocity of the turntable, the top coin will slip first. 12 ', 'course': 'Physique meca'}, {'question': ' For the question, mark the box corresponding to the correct answer. the question has  exactly one correct answer.

How far from P is the center of mass of the system? 3. What is the angular speed of the pendulum when it is at the bottom of its swing? m 1 L 1 L 2 m 2 θ 0 r 2 P ', 'answer': '1. The total moment of inertia of a system about the axis of rotation P is defined to be I tot P = Z M ρ 2 dm, (1) where  ρ  is the distance from the axis P and the integral is performed over the entire mass of the object. Since an integral is just a sum of infinitesimal elements, we can divide the integral into the sum of integrals over the two parts of the system according to I tot P =  I rod P +  I disk P , (2) where I rod P = Z rod ρ 2 dm (3) and I disk P = Z disk ρ 2 dm. (4) We will first calculate  I disk P . Using the parallel axis theorem, we can relate the moment of inertia of the disk about point P  I disk P to its moment of inertia about its center of mass  I disk CM   according to I disk P =  I disk CM   +  m 2 L 2 2 . (5) The moment of inertia of a disk about its center of mass can be found from a table, which is perfectly acceptable. However, here we will show how to derive it from the definition of the moment of inertia I disk CM   = Z disk ρ 2 dm, (6) 6 where  ρ  is the distance from the center of mass of the disk. Since the disk is uniform, we know that its center of mass is at its geometric center and it has an areal density of σ  =   m 2 πr 2 2 =  ∆ m ∆ A  , (7) where  ∆ A  is a differential element of area. We can use  σ  to rewrite the integral over mass in equation (6) as an integral over area according to I disk CM   = Z disk ρ 2 σdA. (8) While the differential area is  dA  =  dxdy  in Cartesian coordinates, we would like to use polar coordinates to reflect the geometry of the disk. In polar coordinates  dA  =  ρdϕdρ , which you can see by calculating the area of a differential element with a small extent in radius  ρ  and angle  ϕ . Thus, we can write I disk CM   = Z  r 2 0 Z  2 π 0 ρ 2 σρdϕdρ, (9) where we’ve chosen the bounds such that the integrals span the entire disk. Since the argument of the integral has no  ϕ  dependence, we find I disk CM   = 2 πσ Z  r 2 0 r 3 dr. (10) The integral over radius is also straightforward, giving I disk CM   = 2 πσ \\x12 r 4 2 4   − 0 \\x13 =   m 2 2   r 2 2 , (11) where we have substituted in equation (7). Combining this with equation (5) gives the final expression for the moment of inertia of the disk about P I disk P =   m 2 2   r 2 2   +  m 2 L 2 2 . (12) To calculate the moment of inertia of the rod, we can use the result from a table, which again is perfectly acceptable. However, here we will again show how to derive it from the definition of the moment of inertia I rod P = Z rod ρ 2 dm, (13) where  ρ  is the distance from the axis P passing through the end of the rod. Since the rod is uniform, we know that it has an linear density of λ  =   m 1 L 1 =  ∆ m ∆ ρ  , (14) where  ∆ ρ  is a linear differential element along the length of the rod. We can use  λ  to rewrite the integral over mass in equation (13) as an integral over length according to I rod P = Z rod ρ 2 λdρ. (15) Thus, the integral over the entire rod is just I rod P =  λ Z  L 1 0 ρ 2 dρ  =  λ \\x12 L 3 1 3   − 0 \\x13 =   m 1 3   L 2 1 . (16) Substituting this and equation (12) into equation (2) gives the final answer of I tot P =   m 1 3   L 2 1   +  m 2 2   r 2 2   +  m 2 L 2 2 . (17) 7 2. The center of mass of any system is given by ⃗ R CM  = P i   m i ⃗ r i P i   m i . (18) Here our system has two objects: the rod and the disk. Given that the rod is uniform, we know that its center of mass is at its midpoint, which is a distance  L 1 / 2  from the point P. Similarly, since the disk is uniform, its center of mass is at its geometric center, which is a distance  L 2  from the axis P. The calculation is one dimensional as both of these distances are in the same direction (i.e. along the length of the rod). Plugging this information into equation (18) gives a distance of R CM  =   m 1 ( L 1 / 2) +  m 2 ( L 2 ) m 1  +  m 2 =   m 1 L 1 / 2 +  m 2 L 2 m 1  +  m 2 . (19) 3. As all of the forces acting on the pendulum system are conservative, we can impose conservation of mechanical energy E mi  =  E mf (20) between the initial state described in the problem (denoted by the subscript  i ) and the final state when the pendulum is at the bottom of its swing (denoted by the subscript  f ). The only forces involved are gravity, so equation (20) is K i  +  U gi  =  K f  +  U gf . (21) The system is released from rest, so  K i  = 0 . Additionally, we will define the reference point for the gravitational potential energy to be the location of the center of mass when the pendulum is at the bottom of its swing, so  U gf  = 0 . Thus, we can use the forms of the rotational kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy to write equation (21) as 0 + ( m 1  +  m 2 )  g ∆ h  =   I tot P 2   ω 2 f   + 0 , (22) where  ∆ h  is the change in height of the center of mass from its final position to its initial position and  ω f  is the angular speed that we are trying to find. From the picture below, we see that  ∆ h  = R CM  − R CM  cos  θ 0 .

Similarly, we can see that cos  θ  =   BD b  , (21) where  BD  is the length of the line connecting points  B  and  D .

Write your answer in terms of some or all of the following:  m A ,  m C ,  g ,  h 0 , and  v 0 . ', 'answer': 'We start by defining our system to include both the acrobat and the clown. The first important observation is that there is a collision between the acrobat and the clown. This collision is completely “inelastic” in that the two bodies collide and stick together after the collision. The details of the collision are determined by the internal forces in the system. Since this is a one-dimensional motion, we will use a coordinate system with the origin at the trampoline and  ˆ y  defined to be upwards. There are two important states to identify in this problem. State 1 is immediately before the collision, at a time that we’ll call  t 1 . At this moment, acrobat has just arrived at the platform of the clown, so both are at the same position y A ( t 1 ) =  y C ( t 1 ) =  h 0 , (1) where  y A ( t )  and  y C ( t )  are the vertical positions of the acrobat and clown respectively. Additionally, just before grabbing the clown the acrobat has a velocity of  ⃗ v A ( t 1 ) =  v A ( t 1 )ˆ y . The collision lasts a time  ∆ t coll . During this time interval, the acrobat grabs the clown. State 2 is immediately after the collision, at a time  t 2 . After the collision, the two people rise together with the same velocity  ⃗ v A ( t ) =  ⃗ v C ( t ) =  v AC ( t )ˆ y . The key assumption is that the time over which the collision occurs is very short  ∆ t coll  =  t 2  − t 1  ≈ 0 . Because the collision is so fast, the impulse delivered by the external gravitational force during the collision is negligibly small. This is the impulse approximation. Because of the impulse approximation, we can say that the total momentum of the system is constant during the collision. If the collision lasts a significant length of time, there would be some slowing down of the acrobat during the collision and we would have to calculate the effect of this. However, by assuming the collision is instantaneous, we can ignore this slowing down and consider the momentum of the system to be conserved. Now let us analyze the time intervals separated by the two states.  Before state 1 , the acrobat is undergoing projectile motion. From one-dimensional kinematics, the vertical component of the position and velocity of 1 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - 7 the acrobat is given by y A ( t ) =  − g 2 t 2  +  v A 0 t  +  y A 0  =  − g 2 t 2  +  v 0 t (2) v A ( t ) =  − gt  +  v A 0  =  − gt  +  v 0 (3) respectively, where  y A 0  = 0  and  v A 0  =  v 0  are the initial position and velocity of the acrobat as given in the problem. At  t  =  t 1  the acrobat is at height  y ( t 1 ) =  h 0 , so we know y A ( t 1 ) =  h 0  =  − g 2 t 2 1   +  v 0 t 1 . (4) Applying the quadratic formula, we find t 1  =   − v 0  ± p v 2 0   − 4( − g/ 2)( − h 0 ) 2( − g/ 2) =   v 0  ∓ p v 2 0   − 2 gh 0 g . (5) Substituting this into equation (3) evaluated at  t  =  t 1  allows us to find the velocity immediately before the collision v A ( t 1 ) =  ± q v 2 0   − 2 gh 0  = q v 2 0   − 2 gh 0 , (6) where we have taken the plus sign as we know the physical velocity must be positive. Between states 1 and 2 , we know from the impulse approximation that momentum is conserved ⃗ p sys ( t 1 ) =  ⃗ p sys ( t 2 ) . (7) Immediately before the collision, the momentum of the acrobat-clown system is only due to acrobat ⃗ p sys ( t 1 ) =  ⃗ p A ( t 1 ) +  ⃗ p C ( t 1 ) =  ⃗ p A ( t 1 ) =  m A v A ( t 1 )ˆ y  =  m A q v 2 0   − 2 gh 0 ˆ y, (8) where we have used equation (6). Immediately after the collision, the acrobat and clown are moving together, so the total momentum of the system is ⃗ p sys ( t 2 ) = ( m A  +  m C ) v AC ( t 2 )ˆ y. (9) Enforcing conservation of momentum (i.e. substituting equations (8) and (9) into equation (7)) allows us to find the velocity of the acrobat and clown immediately after the collision m A q v 2 0   − 2 gh 0 ˆ y  = ( m A  +  m C ) v AC ( t 2 )ˆ y ⇒ v AC ( t 2 ) = m A m A  +  m C q v 2 0   − 2 gh 0 . (10) After state 2 , the acrobat and clown experience projectile motion. Thus, their position and velocity is given by y AC ( t ) =  − g 2 ( t  − t 2 ) 2  +  v AC 0 ( t  − t 2 ) +  y AC 0 (11) v AC ( t ) =  − g ( t  − t 2 ) +  v AC 0 (12) respectively, where we have offset time such that  y AC 0  =  y AC ( t 2 )  and  v AC 0  =  v AC ( t 2 )  are the position and velocity of the acrobat at  t  =  t 2 . Just after the collision, the acrobat and clown are still at the level of the platform so  y AC 0  =  y AC ( t 2 ) =  h 0 .

Assume that the radius of the shaft is much smaller than  ℓ . You may also assume the shaft is rotating fast enough that the mass and the rope are horizontal. Express your answer in terms of the variable  ρ  and some or all of the following parameters:  m 1 ,  m 2 ,  ω , and  ℓ . ', 'answer': 'Given the circular motion of this problem, it is most convenient for us to use cylindrical coordinates. Since the rope has mass, the tension will  not  be constant along its length. However, since it is uniform, it has a constant linear mass density  λ  =  m 1 /ℓ , which is everywhere equal to the total mass of the rope  m 1  divided by its total length  ℓ . We can divide the rope into very small pieces of length  ∆ ρ  in the radial direction, which each have a mass of ∆ m  =  λ ∆ ρ  =   m 1 ℓ ∆ ρ. (1) z ℓ ρ T ( ρ  + Δ ρ ) T ( ρ ) ρ Δ ρ T ( ℓ ) Piece of rope Mass  m 2 We start by considering a piece of the rope that is located an arbitrary distance  ρ  from the shaft, whose free body diagram is shown above. The net radial force on the piece is equal to the difference between the tension on either side X F ρ  =  T ( ρ  + ∆ ρ )  − T ( ρ ) = ∆ T, (2) which is simply the change in tension across the piece  ∆ T . Given that the piece is executing uniform circular motion, we know it is experiencing a centripetal acceleration of  ⃗ a  =  − ρω 2 ˆ ρ . Thus, the radial component of Newton’s second law must be X F ρ  =  − ∆ mω 2 ρ. (3) Combining equations (1), (2), and (3) gives ∆ T  =  − ∆ mω 2 ρ  =  − m 1 ℓ ∆ ρω 2 ρ. (4) Dividing by  ∆ ρ , we see that ∆ T ∆ ρ   =  − m 1 ℓ ω 2 ρ. (5)  In the limit that our very small pieces become infinitesimally small (i.e.  ∆ ρ  → 0 ), equation (5) becomes the differential equation dT dρ   =  − m 1 ℓ ω 2 ρ. (6) From this, we see immediately that the tension decreases with increasing radius as  m 1 ,  ℓ ,  ω 2 , and  ρ  are all positive quantities. We can solve this differential equation by direct integration of both sides of the equation according to Z  dT dρ  dρ  =  − m 1 ω 2 ℓ Z ρdρ. (7) This simplifies to T ( ρ ) =  − m 1 ω 2 2 ℓ ρ 2   +  C, (8) where  C  is an integration constant that we still need to determine. To find it, we need to determine the value of the tension at some location. To do so, we use the fact that the only radial force applied at the end of the rope is by the mass  m 2 . Using the free body diagram for mass  m 2  (shown above), we see that Newton’s second law in the radial direction is − T ( ℓ )ˆ ρ  =  − m 2 ω 2 ℓ ˆ ρ ⇒ T ( ℓ ) =  m 2 ω 2 ℓ.

The mast, of height  h , is perfectly vertical. The initial distance between the top of the mast and the stone is assumed to be zero. 1. The sailboat is docked on land. The girl drops the stone, imparting no initial velocity. How long does it take for the stone to hit the foot of the mast? How far from the foot of the mast does the stone land? Ignore air resistance, and assume the deck of the boat is level with the water. 2. The girl takes the boat onto Lake Geneva and cruises with a constant horizontal velocity  ⃗ v 0 . She repeats her stone dropping experiment from part 1. How long does it take for the stone to hit the deck or water? How far from the foot of the mast does the stone land? Ignore air resistance, and assume the deck of the boat is level with the water. It is 2300, and the girl and her sailboat can travel to space! During her interstellar space exploration, the boat is subject to a constant acceleration  ⃗ a , which is parallel to the mast (i.e. “upwards”) with the magnitude of  | ⃗ a |  =  a  = 9 . 81  m/s 2 . The girl repeats her stone dropping experiment as before. At the moment when the stone is dropped, the velocity of the vessel relative to the stars is colinear to the mast and has a norm  v 0 . Note that the dropped stone is subject to no acceleration. Again find the time for the stone to hit the deck and the distance it lands from the foot of the mast.  Hint: write the equation of motion for the stone as well as for the foot of the mast. ', 'answer': 'For parts 1 and 2 of this problem, we choose a coordinate system at rest with respect to the land when the boat is docked. The  z  axis is parallel to the mast and the  x  axis is horizontal (i.e. along to the ground). The origin corresponds to the foot of the mast at time  t  = 0 , when the stone is dropped. In part 3, we choose a 7  frame of reference relative to the fixed stars. The idea is to have a frame of reference that is fixed while the sailboat or the stone moves. In this problem, it is crucial to realize that the initial velocity of the dropped stone is equal to the velocity of the sailboat at the precise moment when the stone is dropped. 1. The dropped stone undergoes constant acceleration due to gravity  g  in the downwards direction. Thus, we can apply the equations of projectile motion z stone  ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  v z 0 t  +  z 0 . Given our coordinate system, the initial conditions of the stone are  v z 0  = 0  and  z 0  =  h . Thus, the equation of motion for the stone is z stone  ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  h. The time it takes the stone to reach the foot of the mast  t fall  is determined by the condition z stone  ( t fall ) = 0 , so we find t fall  = s 2 h g  . The dimensions are consistent as  [ s ] = p [ m ] / [ m / s 2 ]  as required. The distance that the stone lands relative to the foot of the mast is given by d  =  | x stone  ( t fall )  − x foot  ( t fall ) |  = 0 , where  |  . . .  |  is the absolute value (or magnitude) of the quantity within and  x foot ( t )  is the horizontal location of the foot of the mast. In the horizontal direction, the equation of motion for the stone is x stone ( t ) =  v x 0 t  +  x 0 . (27) However, since the initial conditions are  v x 0  = 0  and  x 0  = 0 , we find simply x stone ( t ) = 0 . Likewise, since the sailboat has no motion in the  x  direction, the equation of motion for the foot of the mast is also  x foot ( t ) = 0 . Thus, we find d  = 0 . 2. Since the velocity of the sailboat is solely in the  x  direction, the equation of motion in  z  is identical to that of part 1, z stone  ( t ) =  h  − 1 2 gt 2 . Therefore, the time it takes for the stone to land remains t fall  = s 2 h g  . Now, since the sailboat moves with a constant velocity in the horizontal direction, the equation of motion in  x  for the foot of the mast is changed to x foot  ( t ) =  v 0 t. 8  However, the horizontal motion of the stone is also changed. Since the girl is riding the moving sailboat, when she drops it with no initial velocity  in her reference frame , it has an velocity  ⃗ v 0  with respect to the reference frame of the land (in which we are doing the calculation). Thus, equation (27) becomes x stone  ( t ) =  v 0 t. Nevertheless, the distance the stone lands relative to the foot of the mast remains unchanged d  =  | x stone  ( t fall )  − x foot  ( t fall ) |  =  v 0 t fall  − v 0 t fall  = 0 . 3. Again, you must determine the equations of motion for the stone and the foot of the mast in the  z  and x  directions. In this part, we take a frame of reference at rest relative to the stars. As soon as the stone is released, it no longer experiences the constant acceleration. Thus, in the  z  direction, the stone follows z stone  ( t ) =  v 0 t  +  h, where we have already substituted the initial velocity and position of the stone. In the  x  direction, the stone has no initial motion or acceleration, so it follows x stone  ( t ) = 0 . The foot of the mast stays with the ship and continues to experience constant acceleration, so it follows z foot ( t ) =  1 2 at 2  +  v 0 t. The mast has no motion in the  x  direction, so x foot ( t ) = 0 . The stone reaches the foot of the mast when z stone  ( t fall ) =  z foot ( t fall ) . Substituting the equations of motion for both sides gives v 0 t fall  +  h  =  1 2 at 2 fall   +  v 0 t fall . Therefore, t fall  = r 2 h a  . Since  a  =  g , the time it takes the stone to reach the foot of the mast  t fall  remains the same as in parts 1 and 2. The distance the stone lands relative to the foot of the mast is still given by d  =  abs  ( x stone  ( t fall )  − x foot  ( t fall ))  , so, as before, the stone falls at the foot of the mast d  = 0 . 9  ', 'course': 'Physique meca'}, {'question': 'A ship sails due southeast with a speed of  v  = 18  km/h.

The origin of the coordinate system coincides with the initial position of the ball. Figure 1: Cartoon of dynamics in the reference frame of the ship a. The ship sails with a constant velocity, so the only acceleration in the entire system is due to gravity. Thus, in the ship frame the ball undergoes projectile motion, which has equations of motions given by x s ( t ) =  v x 0 t  +  x 0 y s ( t ) =  v y 0 t  +  y 0 z s ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  v z 0 t  +  z 0 in the reference frame of the ship. Given the choice of the origin of our coordinate system,  x 0  =  y 0  = z 0  = 0 . Additionally, since the ball is thrown from the ship due east, the initial velocity  v y 0  = 0 . Using the above diagram and trigonometric identities, we see that  v x 0  =  v b  cos  θ  and  v z 0  =  v b  sin  θ . Substituting these initial conditions yields x s ( t ) =  v b t  cos  θ y s ( t ) = 0 z s ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  v b t  sin  θ. These equations represent a parametric form for the trajectory.

First, we take a coordinate system with the  ˆ x  and  ˆ y  unit vectors defined as shown in the figure above. In the  ˆ x  and  ˆ y  directions, Newton’s second law is mg  sin  θ  − F f  =  ma x (1) N  − mg  cos  θ  =  ma y  = 0 ⇒ N  =  mg  cos  θ (2) respectively, where  F f  is the magnitude of the kinetic friction force,  N  is the magnitude of the normal force, and we know that there is no acceleration in the  ˆ y  direction. Using the form of the friction force and equation (2), we find F f  =  µ k N  =  µ k mg  cos  θ. (3) This allows us to calculate the total work done by friction to be W f  = Z  d 0 ⃗ F f  ·  ˆ xdx  =  − Z  d 0 F f dx  =  − F f d  =  − µ k mgd  cos  θ. (4) Plugging in the numerical values, we find W f  =  − (0 . 2)(20  kg )(9 . 8  m / s 2 )(5  m )(cos(20 ◦ )) =  − 180  J . (5) 2. In this part, we will calculate the total work performed on the child and then use the work-kinetic energy theorem to determine the kinetic energy, which allows us to find the final speed. We already know the work done by friction from part 1. The only other force in the problem is gravity, for which we can calculate the work as W g  = Z  0 h 0 ⃗ F g  ·  ˆ ydy  = Z  0 h 0 ( − mg ˆ y )  ·  ˆ ydy  = Z  h 0 0 mg ˆ y  ·  ˆ ydy  =  mg ( h 0  − 0) =  mg ( d  sin  θ ) =  mgd  sin  θ,  (6) where we have adopted a new coordinate system with  ˆ y  pointing straight upwards and note that the child is traveling  from  a height  h 0  to  a height  0 . We also used trigonometry to calculate the height of the slide  h 0  =  d  sin  θ  in terms of known quantities. Thus, the total work performed on the child is W  =  W f  +  W g  =  − µ k mgd  cos  θ  +  mgd  sin  θ. (7) By the work-kinetic energy theorem, this work must be equal to the change in kinetic energy according to W  = ∆ K  =  K f  − K i . (8) Since the child starts at rest, the initial kinetic energy is K i  = 0 . (9) 7 Work and energy - 8 At the bottom, they are moving at some speed  v f  (which we want to calculate), so K f  =  1 2 mv 2 f . (10) Plugging equations (7), (9), and (10) into equation (8) gives − µ k mgd  cos  θ  +  mgd  sin  θ  =  1 2 mv 2 f   − 0 . (11) We can solve this to find that the speed of the child at the bottom of the slide is v f  = p 2 gd  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ ) . (12) Plugging in the numbers gives v f  = p 2(9 . 8  m / s 2 )(5 . 0  m )(sin(20 ◦ )  − (0 . 2) cos(20 ◦ )) = 3 . 9  m / s . (13) 3. To calculate the time it takes for the child to slide down the slide, we use Newton’s second law in the ˆ x  direction (in the coordinate system of part 1). Substituting equation (3) into equation (1) gives a x ( t ) =  g  sin  θ  − µ k g  cos  θ  =  g  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ )  . (14) Integrating this once in time yields the velocity v x ( t ) =  gt  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ )  , (15) where the integration constant is zero because the child starts at rest. Since we know the final speed from part 2, we can use it to calculate the final time  t f  as v x ( t f ) =  v f  =  gt f  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ ) ⇒ t f  = v f g  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ ) . (16) Substituting equation (12) gives t f  = p 2 gd  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ ) g  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ ) = s 2 d g  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ ) . (17) Plugging in the numbers, we find t f  = s 2(5 . 0  m ) (9 . 8  m / s 2 )(sin(20 ◦ )  − (0 . 2) cos(20 ◦ ))  = 2 . 6  s . (18) 4. Since we can assume that the children start and finish at rest, by the work-kinetic energy theorem we know that the total work must be zero. As a child ascends, it experiences two forces. The normal force from the ladder, which the child uses to push itself up, and the gravitational force, which is pulling downwards on the child. Thus, we have W  =  W g  +  W N  = ∆ K  = 0 , (19) where we note that  W N  represents the work done by the child via the normal force. Defining a coordinate system with the origin at the ground and the  ˆ y  direction pointing upwards, we see that the work done by gravity as the child ascends is W g  = Z  h 0 0 ⃗ F g  ·  ˆ ydy  = Z  h 0 0 ( − mg ˆ y )  ·  ˆ ydy  =  − mgh 0 . (20) Substituting this into equation (19) allows us to calculate the work done by the child W N  =  mgh 0 . (21) We see that this doesn’t depend on time, only on the mass of the child. Since the two children have equal masses, they do the same amount of work. 8 ', 'course': 'Physique meca'}, {'question': 'AddressSanitizer (ASan) is a program sanitizer that enforces memory safety policies, detecting out-of-bound accesses, use-after-free, and use-after-return bugs, among others What changes in memory layout does ASan enforce to detect buffer over/under-flows? \\n', 'answer': 'By surrounding the allocated objects with poisoned memory (red zones), contiguous out-of-bounds\\n access will be detected once those red zones are reached.\\n', 'course': 'Introduction to operating systems'}, {'question': 'Explain the following acronyms: AE, MAC, MtE, IV.\\n Say why some ISO 19772 readers have a ﬂat nose.\\n', 'answer': 'Authenticated Encryption, Message Authentication Code, MAC-then-Encrypt, Initialization\\n Vector.\\n Despite all studies, the ISO 19972 standard used the notion of “starting value” by failing\\n to say if it is an IV or a nonce, by failing to say how it is synchronized (or transmitted),\\n and by failing to say how to behave in the case of a padding error.

Draw free body diagrams for both cases, when the book is just about to start sliding. 2. For both cases, calculate the magnitude of your force (as a function of  α ) to just prevent slipping. 3. Calculate the force (as a function of  α ) for which the friction becomes zero. Evaluate your result for α  = 0 ◦ and  α  = 90 ◦ . 3 ', 'answer': '1. Let  m ,  µ s , and  α  be defined as in the problem and let   ⃗ F f  represent the friction force. Additionally, let   ⃗ F p  be the force of your push on the book. We will define our coordinate system such that  x >  0 corresponds to the wall, so that you are pushing from the  x <  0  side. The free body diagrams for both cases are given below. Note that the static friction force opposes the direction that the book is almost moving in. x y α F p F f mg N About to fall down x y α F p F f mg N About to slip up 2. We first consider the case when the book is almost falling down. The frictional force points up and has its maximum value, meaning it has a  norm  given by F f  =  µ s N. Applying Newton’s second law and requiring equilibrium (i.e.  ⃗ a  = 0 ) gives N  =  F p  sin  α in the  ˆ x  direction and µ s N  +  F p  cos  α  − mg  = 0 in the  ˆ y  direction. Using these two equations to eliminate the normal force  N  and solve for  F p  gives the solution of F p  = mg cos  α  +  µ s  sin  α . Next we consider the case when the book is about to slip up. The frictional force points down and has its maximum value, meaning it has a  norm  given by F f  =  µ s N. Applying Newton’s second law and requiring equilibrium (i.e.  ⃗ a  = 0 ) gives N  =  F p  sin  α 8  in the  ˆ x  direction and − µ s N  +  F p  cos  α  − mg  = 0 in the  ˆ y  direction. Using these two equations to eliminate the normal force  N  and solve for  F p  gives the solution of F p  = mg cos  α  − µ s  sin  α . 3. To find the force for which the friction is zero, we can take the limit that  µ s  → 0  in either of the solutions to part 2. This gives F p  =   mg cos  α . Alternatively, one could draw the free body diagrams without the friction force and solve the resulting components of Newton’s second law, which gives the same answer. When  α  = 0 ,  F p  =  mg/  cos (0) =  mg  and when  α  = 90 ◦ ,  F p  =  mg/  cos (90 ◦ )  →∞ , which are both consistent with our intuition. 9 ', 'course': 'Physique meca'}, {'question': ' Formally prove that EvalL satisﬁes (1).\\n', 'answer': 'Clearly, if we write Encpk(bi) = gbiri with ri 2 Q, we have\\n l1\\n EvalL(Encpk(b1); : : : ; Encpk(bn)) = gl1b1+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+lncnr\\n 1\\n (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) rln\\n n\\n By writing l1b1 + (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) + lncn = L(b1; : : : ; bn) + 2q for some integer q, we obtain\\n l1\\n EvalL(Encpk(b1); : : : ; Encpk(bn)) = gL(b1;:::;bn)g2qr\\n 1\\n (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) rln\\n n\\n Since g2 2 Q, we have that g2qr\\n l1\\n 1\\n (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) rln\\n n\\n 2 Q.

What does this quantity represent? 2 ', 'answer': 'x x  = 0 x  =  x eq mg F s k 1. We will choose to use a one-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with the origin defined to be the location of the ceiling. If the spider were located at  x  = 0 , the spring would have a length of zero. 5 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 Thus, the equilibrium position  of the spring  is at  x  =  L , but this is different than the equilibrium position  of the spider  (due to the presence of the gravitational force). We show a free body diagram above, but note that the spring force can point either up or down depending on the location of the spider. The equilibrium position of the spider  x eq  is where the sum of the forces are equal to zero (i.e. the acceleration is  a  = 0 ). This is the definition of “equilibrium.” Using Newton’s second law and the form of the spring force F s  =  k  ( x  − L )  , (1) we find mg  − F s  = 0 ⇒ mg  − k  ( x eq  − L ) = 0 ⇒ x eq  =  L  +   m k  g, (2) where we know that for equilibrium the spring force must be pointing up to counteract gravity. 2. The equation of motion is also found from Newton’s second law, but allowing the spider to be at other positions than the equilibrium position (such that the acceleration  a  is not necessarily zero). At any arbitrary  x  location, Newton’s second law is mg  − F s  =  ma ⇒ mg  − k  ( x  − L ) =  m d 2 x dt 2 ⇒ d 2 x dt 2  +  k m x  =  k m L  +  g. (3) This is the equation of motion for the spider. 3. The problem statement tells us that the general solution to equation (3) has the form x ( t ) =  A  cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) +  x. (4) We can find the values of the constants by substituting equation (4) into equation (3). We start by taking the first and second derivatives to find the velocity and acceleration of the spider to be v ( t ) =   dx dt   =  − Aω 0  sin ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) (5) a ( t ) =   d 2 x dt 2  =  − Aω 2 0   cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) (6) respectively. Substituting equations (4) and (6) into equation (3), we find − Aω 2 0   cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) +  k m   ( A  cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) +  x ) =  k m L  +  g (7) ⇒ \\x12  k m   − ω 2 0 \\x13 A  cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) =   k m L  +  g  − k m x. (8) To solve this equation, we note that the time  t  is an independent parameter and equation (8) must be satisfied for all values of  t . This means that we can separate the equation based on terms with different functional dependences on time (i.e. the terms proportional to  cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ )  and those constant with t ) and require them to zero independently (e.g. equations (9) and (11) below). Equivalently, we can simply evaluate equation (8) at  t  = ( π/ 2  − φ ) /ω 0  to find \\x12  k m   − ω 2 0 \\x13 A  cos \\x12 ω 0 \\x12 π/ 2  − φ ω 0 \\x13 +  φ \\x13 =   k m L  +  g  − k m x ⇒ 0 =   k m L  +  g  − k m x (9) ⇒ x  =  L  +   m k  g, (10) where we note from equation (2) that  x  =  x eq . Then we can substitute this result into equation (8) at any arbitrary time  t  to get \\x12  k m   − ω 2 0 \\x13 A  cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) =   k m L  +  g  − k m \\x10 L  +   m k  g \\x11 ⇒ \\x12  k m   − ω 2 0 \\x13 A  cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) = 0 (11) ⇒ k m   − ω 2 0   = 0 ⇒ ω 0  = r k m . (12) 6 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 4. The problem states that at time  t 0  the velocity of the spider is  v ( t 0 ) = 0  and the spring does not exert a force on the spider. We can use equation (5) to see that the first condition is equivalent to v ( t 0 ) = 0 =  − Aω 0  sin ( ω 0 t 0  +  φ ) ⇒ 0 = sin ( ω 0 t 0  +  φ )  . (13) The sine function evaluates to zero when its argument equals  nπ  for some integer  n  ∈ Z . We are free to arbitrarily choose any integer value of  n  as they all satisfy the equation. This implies that ω 0 t 0  +  φ  =  nπ ⇒ φ  =  nπ  − ω 0 t 0 . (14) Using equations (1) and (4), we see that the second condition corresponds to F s  ( t 0 ) = 0 =  k  ( x  ( t 0 )  − L ) ⇒ x  ( t 0 ) =  L ⇒ A  cos ( ω 0 t 0  +  φ ) +  x  =  L. (15) The condition  x  ( t 0 ) =  L  makes sense. It is saying that, if the force exerted by the spring is zero at t  =  t 0 , the spider must be starting at the equilibrium position  of the spring  L . Substituting equations (10) and (14) gives A  cos ( ω 0 t 0  + ( nπ  − ω 0 t 0 )) + \\x10 L  +   m k  g \\x11 =  L ⇒ A  cos ( nπ ) =  − m k  g (16) ⇒ A  ( − 1) n   =  − m k  g ⇒ A  =  − ( − 1) n  m k  g ⇒ A  =  ± m k  g. (17) This indicates that there are two possible solutions: the plus sign (corresponding to odd values of  n ) or the minus sign (corresponding to even values of  n ). However, we can show that these two solutions are physically identical. If we take the solution with the positive sign (i.e. choosing any odd value of n ) and substitute it into equation (4) along with equation (14), we can determine the position to be x ( t ) = \\x10 m k  g \\x11 cos ( ω 0 t  + ( nπ  − ω 0 t 0 )) +  x  =   m k  g  cos ( ω 0  ( t  − t 0 ) +  nπ ) +  x. (18) In the same way, we can determine the position corresponding to the solution with the negative sign (i.e. choosing any even value of  n ) to be x ( t ) = \\x10 − m k  g \\x11 cos ( ω 0 t  + ( nπ  − ω 0 t 0 )) +  x  =  − m k  g  cos ( ω 0  ( t  − t 0 ) +  nπ ) +  x (19) =   m k  g  cos ( ω 0  ( t  − t 0 ) +  nπ  +  π ) +  x  =  m k  g  cos ( ω 0  ( t  − t 0 ) + ( n  + 1)  π ) +  x (20) using a trigonometric identity to remove the negative sign out in front. The only difference between equation (18) and equation (20) is the choice of  n , which is arbitrary. Thus, without loss of generality, we can take  n  = 1  meaning that equations (14) and (17) become φ  =  π  − ω 0 t 0 (21) A  =   m k  g. (22) 5. The maximum speed of the spider can be found by substituting equation (22) into equation (5) to get v ( t ) =  − \\x10 m k  g \\x11 ω 0  sin ( ω 0 t  +  φ )  . (23) The maximum of this function occurs at the time that  sin ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) =  − 1 . This leads to a maximum speed of v ( t ) =   m k  gω 0  =  m k  g r k m   =  g r m k  , (24) where we have used equation (12). 7 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 6.

Assume that as the raindrop travels through a stationary cloud, it gains mass at a rate proportional to the momentum of the raindrop, dm r dt =  km r v r , where  m r  is the instantaneous mass of the raindrop,  v r  is the instantaneous velocity of the raindrop, and  k is a constant with units of m -1 . You may neglect air resistance. 1. Derive a differential equation for the raindrop’s acceleration  dv r /dt  in terms of  k ,  v r , and the acceler- ation due to gravity  g . 2. What is the terminal speed  v r ∞ of the raindrop? Express your answer in terms of  k  and  g . 1 Momentum and continuous mass transfer', 'answer': '1. We start by choosing a coordinate system such that the  ˆ y  direction points downwards in the direction of the acceleration due to gravity. Note that the problem is one dimensional. Next, at an arbitrary time  t , we consider a system that is composed of the raindrop of instantaneous mass  m r  and a small differential mass element  ∆ m c  from the cloud. The raindrop is moving downwards at an instantaneous velocity  v r , while the differential mass element is at rest (since the cloud is stationary). Thus, we can draw the momentum diagram shown below at time  t . A very short time later at  t +∆ t , the differential mass element from the cloud has been incorporated into the raindrop. This slightly changes the mass of the raindrop to  m r  + ∆ m r  as well as the velocity to  v r  + ∆ v r . This is reflected in the momentum diagram shown below at time  t  + ∆ t . m r Δ m c v r m r  + Δ m r v r  + Δ v r time  t time  t  + Δ t g y From the momentum diagrams, we can use conservation of mass in the system to see that m r  + ∆ m c  =  m r  + ∆ m r ⇒ ∆ m c  = ∆ m r , (1) though this will not actually be needed to solve this problem. Additionally, we see that the total momentum of the system at time  t  is ⃗ p sys ( t ) =  m r v r ˆ y  + ∆ m c (0) =  m r v r ˆ y, (2) while at time  t  + ∆ t  it is ⃗ p sys ( t  + ∆ t ) = ( m r  + ∆ m r )( v r  + ∆ v r )ˆ y. (3) We can now write down the generalized form of Newton’s second law and use the limit form of the time derivative according to ⃗ F   ext net   =  d⃗ p sys dt = lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ ⃗ p sys ∆ t = lim ∆ t → 0 ⃗ p sys ( t  + ∆ t )  − ⃗ p sys ( t ) ∆ t . (4) 3 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - 7 If we drew a free body diagram, we’d see that the only external force on the system is gravity  m r g ˆ y . Using this and substituting equations (2) and (3) into equation (4), we find m r g  = lim ∆ t → 0 ( m r  + ∆ m r )( v r  + ∆ v r )  − m r v r ∆ t = lim ∆ t → 0 m r ∆ v r  + ∆ m r v r  + ∆ m r ∆ v r ∆ t (5) in the  ˆ y  direction. We can neglect the final term  ∆ m r ∆ v r  in this expression as it is product of two differential elements. Since the differential elements are infinitesimally small, a product of two differential elements will be much smaller than terms that include just one differential element (e.g. ∆ m r ∆ v r  ≪ m r ∆ v r ). Thus, equation (5) becomes m r g  =  m r \\x12 lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ v r ∆ t \\x13 + \\x12 lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ m r ∆ t \\x13 v r . (6) Converting the limits back into derivatives, we find the differential equation m r g  =  m r dv r dt   +  dm r dt  v r . (7) As an aside, note that this is equivalent to the standard generalized Newton’s second law applied to the raindrop alone (i.e.  F   ext net   =  dp r /dt  =  d ( m r v r ) /dt  = ( dm r /dt ) v r   +  m r ( dv r /dt )  using the product rule). This holds because the physical situation corresponds to a category 1 case (as defined in lecture 7a), in which the differential mass element carries no momentum. If the differential element did carry momentum (e.g. problem 4 below), the situation becomes more complicated and using the generalized Newton’s second law for the raindrop alone would no longer be accurate. To find an equation for  v r ( t ) , we can substitute the rate of mass gain from the problem statement into equation (7), dm r dt =  km r v r , (8) which fortunately causes all the factors of  m r  to cancel and gives g  =   dv r dt   +  kv 2 r . (9) This is the differential equation the problem asked for. 2. To calculate the terminal velocity  v ∞ of the raindrop, we could solve the differential equation and then take the limit at  t  →∞ . However, there is a much easier way. We know that the raindrop will reach terminal velocity only when its acceleration  dv r /dt  = 0  becomes zero. Otherwise the velocity would still be changing with time, so it wouldn’t be “terminal”. Thus, we can use this fact to write equation (9) as g  = 0 +  kv 2 r ∞ (10) and find that v r ∞ = r g k  .

We start by applying Newton’s second law to the ball in the  ˆ x  direction. The only force is drag, so − βv x  =  ma x .

Initially, the ball is at a radial distance  ρ 0  and has an angular speed  ω 0 . Then, a person grabs the string and pulls it downwards, with a constant speed  V  , until the ball is a distance  ρ f  from the fixed ring. You may neglect the effect of gravity. Show that the work done in pulling the string equals the increase in kinetic energy of the ball. ', 'answer': 'nd   law: Tetherball In this scenario, we are being asked to check the work-kinetic energy theorem. To calculate the net work done on the body, we first need to identify the forces applied. We start by defining a cylindrical coordinate system with the origin located at the fixed ring in the center of the circular motion. We are told that the string is pulled downward with constant velocity, so the body moves inward with  ˙ ρ  =  − V  =  constant and ¨ ρ  = 0 . In order to calculate the work done by the string, we need to know the tension force and the trajectory of the ball. Thus, we want to apply Newton’s second law to the situation, but first we must recall the formula for acceleration in cylindrical coordinates ⃗ a  = \\x10 ¨ ρ  − ρ   ˙ ϕ 2 \\x11 ˆ ρ  + \\x10 2 ˙ ρ   ˙ ϕ  +  ρ ¨ ϕ \\x11 ˆ ϕ  + ¨ z ˆ z. (1) We identify that   ˙ ϕ  =  ω ,  ¨ z  = 0 , so Newton’s 2nd law can be written as − T  =  − mρω 2 (2) 0 =  m (2 ˙ ρω  +  ρ  ˙ ω ) (3) in the radial and tangential directions respectively. The first equation gives us the tension as a function of radius, but we do not know how  ω  changes with radius. This can be found from the second equation, which can be rewritten as 1 ω dω dt   =  − 2 ρ dρ dt ⇒ 1 ω  dω  =  − 2 ρ dρ. (4) Integrating this gives Z 1 ω  dω  =  − 2 Z  1 ρ dρ ⇒ ln( ω ) =  − 2 ln( ρ )+ C ⇒ ln( ω ) = ln \\x00 ρ − 2 \\x01 + C ⇒ ω ( ρ ) =  ρ − 2   exp( C ) ,  (5) 1 Work and energy - 8 where  C  is an integration constant and we have used identities that  A  ln( B ) = ln( B A )  and  exp( A  +  B ) = exp( A ) exp( B ) . Substituting the initial condition that  ω ( ρ 0 ) =  ω 0  allows us to calculate that the integration constant is ω ( ρ 0 ) =  ω 0  =  ρ − 2 0 exp( C ) ⇒ exp( C ) =  ω 0 ρ 2 0 . (6) Substituting this into equation (5) gives ω ( ρ ) =   ρ 2 0 ρ 2  ω 0 . (7) Together with equation 2, this allows us to calculate the tension T  =  m ρ 4 0 ρ 3  ω 2 0 . (8) We can now consider the work done by the tension on the ball, as it is the only force in the problem. From the above figure, we see that the tension force is always pointed inwards. Thus, the work done by the string in moving the ball from a radius  ρ 0  to a radius  ρ f  is given by W  = Z ⃗ T  ·  d ⃗ l  =  − Z T  ˆ ρ  ·  d ⃗ l  =  − Z  ρ f ρ 0 Tdρ.

To calculate the change in kinetic energy, we can use the formula ∆ K  =  K f  − K 0  =  1 2 mv 2 f   − 1 2 mv 2 0 , (11) where the subscripts  f  and  0  indicate the final and initial values respectively. To calculate the velocity, we can use its formula in cylindrical coordinates ⃗ v  = ˙ ρ ˆ ρ  +  ρ   ˙ ϕ ˆ ϕ  + ˙ z ˆ z (12) and note that  ˙ ρ  = 0 ,  ˙ z  = 0  in the initial and final states. Thus, the initial and final speeds are v 0  =  ρ 0 ω 0 (13) v f  =  ρ f ω f (14) 2 Work and energy - 8 respectively. Plugging these into equation 11 reveals that ∆ K  =  1 2 mρ 2 f ω 2 f   − 1 2 mρ 2 0 ω 2 0   =  mρ 4 0 ω 2 0 2   ρ 2 f ω 2 f ρ 4 0 ω 2 0 − 1 ρ 2 0 ! , (15) but we still must determine  ω f . This can be done by evaluating equation 7 at  ρ  =  ρ f  to find ω ( ρ f ) =  ω f  =   ρ 2 0 ρ 2 f ω 0 .

The instrument has an initial speed  v 0 (with respect to the planet), while it is initially traveling at an angle  θ  with respect to a radial line between the center of the planet and the launch position of the instrument. For what angle  θ  will the instrument just graze the surface of the planet? r p m p θ m i ', 'answer': 'After the instrument is launched, the only force it will experience is its gravitational attraction to the planet. This force is given by ⃗ F G  =  − Gm p m i r 2 ˆ r, (1) where  r  is the distance between the instrument and the center of the planet,  ˆ r  is the radial unit vector pointing from the center of the planet towards the instrument, and  G  is the universal gravitational constant.

Thus, since the total external torque on the instrument about the center of the planet is zero, its angular momentum about the center of the planet must be conserved throughout its motion. Conservation of angular momentum is expressed as ⃗ L i  =   ⃗ L f , (3) where the angular momentum is ⃗ L  =  ⃗ r  ×  ⃗ p  =  ⃗ r  ×  m i ⃗ v. (4) Here  ⃗ p  and  ⃗ v  are the momentum and velocity of the instrument respectively. It is natural to define a cylindrical coordinate system with its origin at the center of the planet. The initial velocity can be found from trigonometry and the figure below to be ⃗ v i  =  − v 0  cos  θ ˆ r  +  v 0  sin  θ   ˆ ϕ.

At this instant, the position vector is  ⃗ r f  =  r p ˆ r  and the final velocity  ⃗ v f  =  v f   ˆ ϕ  is in the direction exactly tangent to the surface. Thus, the final angular momentum is ⃗ L f  = ( r p ˆ r )  ×  m i \\x10 v f   ˆ ϕ \\x11 =  r p m i v f \\x10 ˆ r  ×   ˆ ϕ \\x11 =  r p m i v f  ˆ z.

(8) However, this equation still has two unknowns  v f  and  θ , so we require another condition. To determine the final velocity of the instrument, we can think about the situation physically. We realize that the instrument will be accelerated as it falls into the gravitational potential of the planet. The change in speed of the instrument can be found from conservation of mechanical energy because there are no nonconservative forces acting on the instrument. Thus, we have E mi  =  E mf ⇒ K i  +  U Gi  =  K f  +  U Gf .

The chain is released and falls onto the scale. What is the force measured by the scale when a length of chain D  has fallen? Assume that the individual links of the chain are infinitesimally small and let  g  denote the acceleration due to gravity. ', 'answer': 'This problem is challenging. We start by taking a coordinate system with  ˆ y  pointing downwards in the direction of the acceleration due to gravity and note that the problem is one dimensional. We will let  t  = 0 be the moment that the chain is dropped. Next, we can divide up the chain into many differential elements, each of length  ∆ y . Then, we will consider the differential element that starts a distance  D  above the scale 4 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - 7 and define its initial position as the origin of our coordinate system. You can’t push with a chain, so there is no force from the ground that is transmitted up the chain to the differential elements still in the air. In other words, each differential element of the chain is in free fall and governed by projectile motion until it makes contact with the scale. Thus, given our coordinate system and the fact that the chain starts at rest, the position and velocity of the differential element follows ⃗ r ( t ) =  y ( t )ˆ y  =  1 2 gt 2 ˆ y (1) ⃗ v ( t ) =  v y ( t )ˆ y  =  gt ˆ y (2) respectively. Using equation (1), we can calculate the time  t  just before the differential element of interest makes contact with the scale to be y ( t ) =  D  =  1 2 gt 2 ⇒ t  = s 2 D g  . (3) Substituting this into equation (2), we see that the element is traveling with a velocity of ⃗ v ( t ) =  v y ( t )ˆ y  =  g s 2 D g   ˆ y  = p 2 gD ˆ y (4) just before it impacts the scale. A very short time later  t  + ∆ t , the differential element is at rest on the scale. We can calculate the force required to cause this through the change in momentum of the differential element. First, we need the mass ∆ m . We have choosen to divide up the rope into differential elements of length  ∆ y . Thus, given that the linear mass density  λ  of the chain is uniform, we can find the mass according to λ  =   M L   = ∆ m ∆ y ⇒ ∆ m  =   M L   ∆ y. (5) We can now define a system composed of exclusively the differential element of interest and draw momentum diagrams at time  t  and  t  + ∆ t  (see below). Using equations (4) and (5), the momentum of such a system at time  t  is ⃗ p sys ( t ) = ∆ m⃗ v ( t ) = \\x12 M L   ∆ y \\x13 \\x10p 2 gD ˆ y \\x11 = p 2 gD M L   ∆ y ˆ y, (6) while at  t  + ∆ t  the total momentum is ⃗ p sys ( t  + ∆ t ) = ∆ m (0) = 0 . (7) Scale D t t  + Δ t Scale Δ y g y v y ( t ) D Δ y We can then write down the generalized form of Newton’s second law and use the limit form of the time derivative according to ⃗ F   ext net   =  d⃗ p sys dt = lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ ⃗ p sys ∆ t = lim ∆ t → 0 ⃗ p sys ( t  + ∆ t )  − ⃗ p sys ( t ) ∆ t . (8) 5 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - 7 The external force will be only the normal force from the scale on the differential element ⃗ F   ext net   =  − F scale ˆ y, (9) which is what we are interested in calculating to determine the reading on the scale. This is because the gravitational force can be neglected through the impulse approximation, since the time interval  ∆ t  is so short. Substituting equations (6), (7) and (9) into equation (8), we find − F scale  = lim ∆ t → 0 0  − √ 2 gD ( M/L )∆ y ∆ t =  − p 2 gD M L \\x12 lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ y ∆ t \\x13 (10) in the  ˆ y  direction. Converting the limit back into a derivative gives F scale  = p 2 gD M L dy dt  . (11) Using the definition of velocity as the derivative of position  v y  =  dy/dt  and making use of equation (4) gives F scale  = p 2 gD M L  v y  = p 2 gD M L \\x10p 2 gD \\x11 = 2 gD M L  , (12) the magnitude of the upwards force exerted by the scale on the differential element of the chain. If we drew a free body diagram for the scale at time  t  + ∆ t , we would see that there are two forces from the chain acting on it: the normal force from the differential element that just impacted the scale and the normal force from the part of the chain that is already sitting stationary on the scale. The length of chain already on the scale is  D , so we can use the linear density to find its mass to be  m  =  λD  =  D ( M/L ) . Thus, the part of the chain sitting on the scale exerts a downward force with a magnitude of  mg  =  D ( M/L ) g . Adding this to the action-reaction pair of equation (12) gives a total downwards force of the chain on the scale of Scale reading  =  D M L  g  + 2 gDM L   = 3 gDM L  . (13) This is our final answer for the reading on the scale. Note that since  D  was an arbitrary location, we can use equation (3) to replace  D  in equation (13) with  t . This allows us to see how the scale reading depends on time Scale reading  =  3 2 M L  g 2 t 2 . (14) Thus, the scale reading increases quadratically with time. The top end of the chain will land on the scale when  D  =  L , at which time equation (13) becomes Scale reading  = 3 Mg. (15) In other words, the maximum reading of the scale is three times the mass of the rope. Of course, after the entire chain has come to rest, the reading on the scale will drop to the weight of the chain, i.e. Scale reading  =  Mg.

At what position does the collision occur? 4. What is the minimum speed  v 0  required to ensure the stone and the cheese collide? ', 'answer': 'Crow Fox O x y v 0 α L H g 1,2. We start by taking the diagram provided with the question and defining the angle  α  as well as a convenient coordinate system. The origin  O  is the position of the fox, the angle  α  defines the direction of the initial velocity of the stone relative to the  x  axis, the  y  axis is defined to be anti-parallel to  ⃗ g , and the  x  axis is defined to be in the direction of the initial horizontal velocity of the stone. Both objects experience projectile motion, so we can directly write their equations of motion. For the stone we have x s   ( t ) =  v s x 0 t  +  x s 0 and y s   ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  v s 0 y t  +  y s 0 . Similarly, for the cheese we have x c   ( t ) =  v c x 0 t  +  x c 0 and y c   ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  v c 0 y t  +  y c 0 . The initial conditions of the stone are  x s 0   = 0 ,  y s 0   = 0 ,  v s x 0   =  v 0   cos  α , and  v s y 0   =  v 0   sin  α , while the initial conditions of the cheese are  x c 0   =  L ,  y c 0   =  H ,  v c x 0   = 0 , and  v c y 0   = 0 . Substituting these values gives x s   ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  α (1) y s   ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  v 0 t  sin  α (2) 1  for the stone and x c   ( t ) =  L (3) y c   ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  H. (4) for the cheese. For the stone and cheese to collide, there must be a single time  t  =  t coll  for which they are at the exact same position. We can write this condition as x s   ( t coll ) =  x c   ( t coll ) (5) and y s   ( t coll ) =  y c   ( t coll )  . (6) Substituting the equations of motion for the stone and cheese from above, equation (5) becomes v 0 t coll  cos  α  =  L, which implies that t coll  = L v 0  cos  α . Using basic trigonometry and the Pythagorean theorem, the figure above shows that  cos  α  =  L/ √ L 2   +  H 2 . Substituting this gives t coll  = √ L 2   +  H 2 v 0 . (7) In the  y  direction we use equation (6), which is − 1 2 gt 2 coll   +  v 0 t coll   sin  α  =  − 1 2 gt 2 coll   +  H. Crucially, we see that the gravitational acceleration terms on both sides cancel and gravity disappears from the problem, leaving v 0 t coll  sin  α  =  H. Solving for the time and using trigonometry to show  sin  α  =  H/ √ L 2   +  H 2 , we find that t coll  = H v 0  sin  α   = √ L 2   +  H 2 v 0 . (8) We see that the collision times we calculated in equations (7) and (8) are identical. This means we really do have a collision – the stone and cheese are at the same  x  and  y  location at the same time. This occurs at time t coll  = √ L 2   +  H 2 v 0 . Note that the fact that there is a collision does not depend on the value of  v 0  nor  g ! 3. The position of the collision can be found by substituting the collision time  t coll  back into the equations of motion. Using equation (1) or (3), the  x  position is simply x s   ( t coll ) =  x c   ( t coll ) =  L. (9) Using equation (2) or (4) and a bit of algebra, we find that the  y  location of the collision is y s   ( t coll ) =  y c   ( t coll ) =  − 1 2 gt 2 coll   +  H  =  − g 2 L 2   +  H 2 v 2 0 +  H. (10) 2  4. Above, we have shown that the stone and cheese always collide, without posing any restriction on the initial speed of the stone. However, in reality there is a restriction to impose – if the initial speed is not large enough, the stone will hit the ground before it hits the cheese. This does not contradict the above derivation – for low initial speeds the above derivation simply predicts that the collision would take place underground (i.e. at  y <  0 ). In order for the collision to take place above ground, we must enforce that y c   ( t coll )  >  0 . Using equation (10), this is equivalent to − g 2 L 2   +  H 2 v 2 0 +  H >  0 . Rearranging, we see that the constraint on the initial speed is v 0  > r g  L 2  +  H 2 2 H .

Find the acceleration and speed of the cart after it has been pulled for 3 seconds. 3. Find the minimum value of the coefficient of static friction in order for the wheels to roll without slipping. F d Side view F d Top view M m ', 'answer': 'F d N a mg F f N a mg N g F f x y z N a N g 1. Due to the symmetry of the system, the free body diagram for all of the wheels is identical and is shown above. There are four forces on each wheel: gravity acting at the center of mass of the wheel (i.e. the center of the wheel), the normal force from the axle of the cart, the normal force from the ground, and the static friction force from the ground. 2. To approach this problem, it is best to first think about which objects are moving together and the different types of motion that are occurring. Since the wheels and the body of the cart are attached via the axles, the translational motion of the centers of the wheels and the cart must be identical. Thus, we can consider the cart-wheels system as a whole and write Newton’s second law in the horizontal direction as X  ⃗ F  = ( M  + 4 m ) ⃗ a ⇒ F d  − 4 F f  = ( M  + 4 m )  a, (1) where  a  is the acceleration of the cart as well as the centers of the wheels. Note that all other forces are internal forces within the cart-wheels system, so they cancel due to Newton’s third law. However, there is one other type of motion, which is the rotation of the wheels. Enforcing the no- slip condition will allow us to relate the frictional force causing the rotation of the wheels with the translational motion of the whole cart. We start by writing Newton’s second law for the rotation of a single wheel in the  ˆ z  direction as X ⃗ τ  =  I w ⃗ α ⇒ ⃗ R f  ×   ⃗ F f  =   m 8   d 2 ⃗ α ⇒ \\x12 − d 2  ˆ y \\x13 × ( − F f  ˆ x ) =  − m 8   d 2  dω dt   ˆ z ⇒ F f  =   m 4   ddω dt  ,  (2) where  I w  =  m ( d/ 2) 2 / 2 =  md 2 / 8  is the moment of inertia of the wheel about its axle,  ⃗ α  is the angular acceleration of the wheel,   ⃗ R f  is the position vector from the axle to the point of application of the friction force, and  ω  is the angular velocity of the wheel in the  ˆ z  direction. The condition for rolling without slipping is given by ω  = v d/ 2 , (3) where  v  is the translational velocity of the center of the wheel (as well as the cart as a whole). Substituting this into equation (2) gives F f  =   m 4   d \\x12 2 d dv dt \\x13 =   m 2   a.

(5) 4 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 Since the acceleration is constant, it is straightforward to integrate this to find that the velocity is v ( t ) =  at  +  v 0  =  at  = F d M  + 6 m t, (6) where the problem statement tells us that the initial velocity is  v 0  = 0 . Plugging in the numerical values into equations (5) and (6) gives  a  = 0 . 94  m/s 2   and  v  = 2 . 8  m/s after  t  = 3  seconds respectively. 3. To calculate the required coefficient of static friction to enable rolling without slipping, we first must calculate the magnitude of the static friction force. This can be found by substituting equation (5) into equation (4) to see F f  =   m 2 F d M  + 6 m . (7) We then require that this force be less than the maximum possible static friction force F f  ≤ µ s N g ⇒ m 2 F d M  + 6 m   ≤ µ s N g ⇒ µ s  ≥ m 2 1 N g F d M  + 6 m .

The axe is composed of a handle with length 4 ℓ and mass  m  and a small metal blade of equal mass  m  that is fixed to one end of the handle. You throw the axe at the target, releasing it such that its center of mass has a horizontal velocity of  v xi  and a vertical velocity of  v yi . You release the axe such that it also rotates around its center of mass with an initial angular velocity of  ω i ˆ z . It leaves your hand with the handle of the axe vertical and the blade at the top end of the handle (as shown in the figure above). You want to hit the target with the blade of the axe. At the moment you release the axe, the target is a horizontal distance  d  and a vertical distance  ℓ above the center of mass of the axe. The target is painted on a board of height 2 h  and thickness 2 r . It is just sitting on the ground and, hence, is free to pivot about an axis in the ˆ z  direction passing though  p  by changing the angle  θ . After the collision, the board and axe together have a total mass  M . The center of mass of the combined object is at the geometric center of the board and the combined moment of inertia about  p  is  I p . You may assume that •  the axe can be modeled as a thin uniform straight rod of mass  m  with a point mass (representing the blade) of mass  m  at one end, •  the angular position of the axe about its center of mass can be quantified by  ϕ  (i.e. the angle from the +ˆ x  vector to the vector running along the axe handle towards the blade), •  the axe is released upright (i.e. the initial angular position is  ϕ i  =  π/ 2), •  the axe is released rotating clockwise (i.e.  ω i  <  0), •  the duration of the collision between the axe and the board is very short, •  the board is free to rotate about  p  and does not translate, •  air drag is negligible, and •  the acceleration due to gravity is  − g ˆ y . A Cartesian coordinate system is shown above, which you may use if you wish. The origin is defined to be the location of the center of mass of the axe at the moment it is released.

Final exam 6/8 Dr. Justin Ball a. Determine the horizontal  x b ( t ) and vertical  y b ( t ) positions of the  blade  of the axe as a function of time  t . Note that you may use  v yi  and  ω i  in your answer (in addition to the variables stated on the previous page). You may find the trigonometric identities sin ( β  +  π/ 2) = cos  β  and cos ( β  +  π/ 2) =  − sin  β  useful. ', 'answer': 'a. The axe exhibits two types of motion as it moves through the air: translation of its center of mass and rotation about its center of mass. Since the only force acting on the axe is gravity, the center of mass follows ballistic motion. Thus, as in problem 2.a, we can immediately write down the expressions for the horizontal and vertical positions of the center of mass, which are x CM ( t ) =  v xi t  +  x i (1) y CM ( t ) =  − g 2 t 2  +  v yi t  +  y i (2) respectively. Note that, because  ˆ y  points upwards in this problem, the gravitational term needs to have a negative sign. The coordinate system is defined such that  x i  = 0  and  y i  = 0 , so we find x CM ( t ) =  v xi t (3) y CM ( t ) =  − g 2 t 2  +  v yi t. (4) Next we must calculate the effect of the rotational motion. First, we must determine the location of center of mass along the handle, to see how far it is from the blade. We will define new coordinate  s , which has its origin at the location of the blade and increases as you move along the handle. In this coordinate system, we know that the center of mass of the handle on its own is at  s h  = 2 ℓ . This is because the handle is uniform and symmetric, so we know that it is midway along its length and the handle is  4 ℓ long. Since we can model the blade as a point mass, its center of mass is at its location of s b  = 0 . Thus, the center of mass of the entire axe (i.e. handle and blade together) is a distance of s CM  = P i   m i s i P i   m i =   ms h  +  ms b m  +  m =  ℓ (5) away from the blade. Since there is no air resistance, while the axe is flying through the air, it experiences no torque. This means the blade of the axe undergoes uniform circular motion with its initial angular velocity of  ω i ˆ z at a radius of  ρ  =  s CM  =  ℓ away from the center of mass. Given such uniform circular motion, we know that the velocity of the blade of the axe around the center of mass is ⃗ v b  =  v ϕ   ˆ ϕ  =  ℓω i   ˆ ϕ  =  ℓω i  ( − sin  ϕ ˆ x  + cos  ϕ ˆ y )  , (6) where we have used the cylindrical coordinate unit vector to Cartesian coordinates using the relation ˆ ϕ  =  − sin  ϕ ˆ x +cos  ϕ ˆ y . We need to perform this conversion because the problem asks us for the position in Cartesian coordinates. We want to find the position, so, since velocity is the derivative of position, we can write d⃗ r b dt   =  ℓω i  ( − sin ( ϕ ( t )) ˆ x  + cos ( ϕ ( t )) ˆ y )  . (7) We would like to integrate this, but one subtlety, which we have made explicit in this formula, is that the angular position  ϕ ( t )  is changing with time. To determine how it varies, we remember that the angular velocity is constant  ω ( t ) =  ω i  and that  ω ( t ) =  dϕ/dt . Combining these two relationships and integrating once in time gives  ϕ ( t ) =  ω i t  +  C . Since the initial condition for the angular position is ϕ (0) =  π/ 2 , we see that  C  =  π/ 2  and the angular position varies with time according to ϕ ( t ) =  ω i t  +   π 2   .

Now we can directly integrate this expression to find ⃗ r b ( t ) =  − ℓ sin ( ω i t ) ˆ x  +  ℓ cos ( ω i t ) ˆ y  +   ⃗ C, (10) where   ⃗ C  is a constant that is a vector (since the equation is a vector equation). To determine it we use the initial condition that the blade is above the center of mass and a distance of  ℓ away, so  ⃗ r b (0) =  ℓ ˆ y . Applying this initial condition we see that   ⃗ C  = 0 , so equation (10) becomes ⃗ r b ( t ) =  − ℓ sin ( ω i t ) ˆ x  +  ℓ cos ( ω i t ) ˆ y, (11) which is the position of the blade relative to the center of mass. Lastly, we must combine the translational motion (given by equations (3) and (4)) and rotational motion (given by equation (11)) to find the motion of the blade in the laboratory coordinate system defined in the problem statement. This can be accomplished by vector addition as equations (3) and (4) give the position of the center of mass in the laboratory frame and equation (11) gives the position of the blade relative to the center of mass. Thus, we sum the components of equation (11) with equations (3) and (4) to find the final answer x b ( t ) =  v xi t  − ℓ sin ( ω i t ) (12) y b ( t ) =  − g 2 t 2  +  v yi t  +  ℓ cos ( ω i t )  .

The cannonball lands a distance of  P  = 40  km away. The recoil of the cannon is absorbed by a spring with a stiffness of  k  = 10 5   N/m that is at its equilibrium position before the shot is fired. Neglect friction, air drag, and small variations in gravitational potential energy due to the cannon’s motion. 1. How far does the spring compress during the shot?', 'answer': 'As a result of the explosion, the entire cannon moves backwards and the spring compresses. The energy of the system is comprised of kinetic  K  and spring potential energy  U s . We will ignore any small change in the elevation of the cannon, thereby neglecting the gravitational potential energy  U g . Given that energy is always conserved, we have K i  +  U si  =  K f  +  U sf . (1) We will take the initial state to be the moment immediately after the explosion, when the cannon is moving at its maximum speed  V 0 , but the spring is still at its equilibrium position. For the final state, we will take the moment when the spring has its maximum displacement  ∆ x max  and the cannon has come to a temporary rest. Thus, equation (1) becomes M/2 * V0^2  + 0 = 0 +  k/2 ∆ xmax^2 max, ∆ x max  = sqrt(M / k) * V0 . (2) Unfortunately, we do not know the initial speed of the cannon  V 0 . To find this, we must use the information given in the problem statement about the dynamics of the cannonball. To relate the dynamics of the cannon to that of the cannonball, we can use conservation of momentum. Given that the cannon-cannonball system is initially at rest, conservation of momentum is 0 =  mv 0 ˆ u  − MV 0 ˆ u ⇒ V 0  =   m M  v 0 , (3) where  v 0  is the initial velocity of the cannonball and the  ˆ u  direction is defined in the diagram above.

We will define the origin of the coordinate system to be the cannon, such that the cannonball is at  x 0  = 0  and y 0  = 0  when the cannon fires at  t  = 0 .

Next, if the center of mass velocity is constant, then we know that the center of mass position is linear in time ⃗ R CM ( t ) =   ⃗ V CM (0) t  +   ⃗ R CM (0) . (5) Thus, we just need to find the initial center of mass position   ⃗ R CM (0)  and initial center of mass velocity ⃗ V CM (0) . Since the problem statement gives us the state of the system at  t  = 0 , we can compute these quantities using equations (1) and (2). We will first calculate the center of mass position. At  t  = 0 , we can deduce that the center of mass of the rod is ⃗ r 1 (0) =   L 2  ˆ y (6) by symmetry. Alternatively, as in part 1 of problem 1 above, this could be found by integrating over the constant mass distribution  λ  =  M/L  =  dm/dy  of the rod according to ⃗ r 1 (0) = R M   ⃗ rdm R M   dm  = R  L 0   ⃗ rλdy R  L 0   λdy =   λ R  L 0   y ˆ ydy λ R  L 0   dy = R  L 0   ydy R  L 0   dy ˆ y  =  ( y 2 / 2] y = L y =0 ( y ] L 0 ˆ y  =   L 2 / 2  − 0 L  − 0 ˆ y  =   L 2  ˆ y, (7) where R M ( . . . ) dm  indicates an integral over the entire mass distribution of the whole object. At time  t  = 0 , the particle is at the origin, so its center of mass is at ⃗ r 2 (0) = 0 .

Assume that  X  has this form except that the last row/feature is then multiplied by \\n[] √ 2, i.e., it has \\n[] variance ( ℓ 2 \\n[] 2 -norm) of 2 instead of 1. \\n[] Recall that the SVD allows us to write  X  in the form  X  =  USV   ⊤ , where  U  and  V  are unitary and  S  is a  D  ×  N \\n[] diagonal matrix with entries  s i  that are non-negative and decreasing, called the singular values. \\n[] Assume now that you add a feature, i.e., you add a row to  X . Assume that this row is identical to the last row of  X , \\n[] i.e., you just replicate the last feature. Call the new matrix  ˜ \\n[] X . But assume also that for  ˜ \\n[] X  we normalize all rows to \\n[] have variance 1. \\n[] To summarize,  X  is the original data matrix, where all means have been taken out and all rows are properly normalized \\n[] to have variance 1 except the last one that has variance 2. And  ˜ \\n[] X  is the original data matrix with the last row \\n[] replicated, and all means have been taken out and all rows are properly normalized. \\n[] Let  X  =  U  · S · V   ⊤ be the SVD of  X  and let. \\n[] ˜ \\n[] X  =  ˜ \\n[] U  ·   ˜ \\n[] S ·   ˜ \\n[] V   ⊤ be the SVD of  ˜ \\n[] X . \\n[] 1. Show that \\n[] (a)  ˜ \\n[] V  =  V \\n[] (b)  ˜ \\n[] S  is equal to  S  with an extra all-zero row attached. \\n[] 2. Based on the previous relationships and assuming that it is always best to run an SVD with “normalized” rows, \\n[] what is better: If you  KNOW  that a feature is highly correlated to another feature a priori. Should you rather \\n[] ﬁrst run the SVD and then ﬁgure out what features to keep or should you ﬁrst take the highly correlated feature \\n[] out and then run the SVD? Explain. \\n[] 0 \\n[] 0.5 \\n[] 1 \\n[] 1.5 \\n[] 2 \\n[] 2.5 \\n[] 3 \\n[] 3.5 \\n[] 4  Reserved, do not write on this box', 'answer': ' 1. In the exercise you learned that the columns of  V  are the eigenvectors associated to  X ⊤ X . And the non-zero singular values of  X  are the square roots of the non-zero eigenvalues of  X ⊤ X . But for our case  ˜ X ⊤ ˜ X  =  X ⊤ X , which proves the two claims. 2. It is better to ﬁrst take out the highly correlated feature. If not, then the previous calculations show that this is the same as having a row that is not properly normalized.

The ball has a radius of  R  and a mass of  m . As shown in the figure above, the ball is thrown purely horizontally from a height  h 0  with an initial speed of  v 0 . It falls under the influence of gravity and impacts the ground, which has a coefficient of static and kinetic friction  µ . As a result of colliding with the ground, the ball temporarily deforms by flattening an  unknown  vertical distance of ∆ y c  that changes with time while in contact with the ground. Given that the elasticity of the ball resists such a deformation, we can model the normal force of the ball on the ground as an ideal spring with a spring constant  k  and an equilibrium length ∆ y c  = 0. The collision with the ground lasts for an  unknown  duration ∆ t c  after which the ball bounces upwards and reaches an  unknown  maximum final height of  h f  at an  unknown horizontal distance  d f  from its starting point. You may assume that •  the ground is flat and horizontal, •  the ball is released without any rotation about its center of mass, •  the deformation is small compared to the radius of the ball (i.e. ∆ y c  ≪ R ) so that the ball can be approximated as a sphere at all times, •  the radius of the ball is very small compared to the height it is thrown from (i.e.  R  ≪ h 0 ), •  the collision time ∆ t c  is very short compared to the time in free fall, •  the coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the ball and ground are both equal to  µ , •  the ball has a uniform mass distribution, •  air drag is negligible, and •  the acceleration due to gravity is  g ˆ y . A Cartesian coordinate system is shown above, which you may use if you wish. The origin is defined to be directly below the initial location of the center of mass of the basketball, at a distance of  R above the level of the ground. The unit vector ˆ x  points in the direction of the initial velocity of the ball, ˆ y  points down, and ˆ z  points into the page.

Final exam 4/8 Dr. Justin Ball a. Calculate the horizontal distance traveled by the ball when it first touches the ground  d c . ', 'answer': 'a. In the solutions, we will choose to exclusively use the coordinate system given in the problem statement. It is perfectly fine to define your own coordinate with  ˆ y  pointing upwards, but then  ˆ z  must then point out of the page (for the coordinate system to be right-handed). This will make the earlier parts of this problem easier, but the last part will be harder (as the angular velocity will be in the  − ˆ z  direction). This part of the problem is simple ballistic motion. We can immediately write down the expressions for the positions and velocities in the horizontal and vertical directions, which are x ( t ) =  v x 0 t  +  x 0 (1) v x ( t ) =  v x 0 (2) y ( t ) =   g 2 t 2  +  v y 0 t  +  y 0 (3) v x ( t ) =  gt  +  v y 0 . (4) We see that the terms with  g  are positive (instead of negative as is the case when  ˆ y  points upwards). From the problem statement, we know that the initial conditions are  v x 0  =  v 0 ,  v y 0  = 0 ,  x 0  = 0 , and y 0  =  − h 0 . Thus, our equations of motion become x ( t ) =  v 0 t (5) v x ( t ) =  v 0 (6) y ( t ) =   g 2 t 2  − h 0 (7) v x ( t ) =  gt. (8) To find the location at which the ball hits the ground  d c , we must first calculate the time at which the ball hits the ground  t c . This is defined by  y ( t c ) = 0 . Using equation (7), we see 0 =   g 2 t 2 c   − h 0 ⇒ t c  = s 2 h 0 g  . (9) The horizontal distance traveled in this time is  d c  =  x ( t c ) .

Using conservation of energy, find the kinetic energy of the block at the top of the loop  K t . 2.

What was the original distance  x  that the spring was compressed by? ', 'answer': '1. As the block is initially at rest  v 0  = 0 , the initial kinetic energy before the latch is released is  K 0  = mv 2 0 / 2 = 0 . The initial potential energy of the compression of the spring is given by  U s 0   =  kx 2 / 2 . We will define the origin of our coordinate system to be at the height of the horizontal track, so the initial height of the block is  y 0  = 0  and the initial gravitational potential energy is  U g 0  =  mgy 0  = 0 . Therefore, the total initial energy is E 0  =  K 0  +  U s 0  +  U g 0  = 0 +   k 2 x 2  + 0 =  k 2 x 2 . (1) At the top of the loop  y t  = 2 R , the kinetic energy is  K t  =  mv 2 t   / 2 , the gravitational potential energy is  U gt  =  mgy t  = 2 mgR , and the spring is no longer in contact with the block so  U st  = 0 . Thus, the total energy at the top of the loop is given by E t  =  K t  +  U st  +  U gt  =   m 2   v 2 t   + 0 + 2 mgR  =  m 2   v 2 t   + 2 mgR. (2) Since the track is frictionless and there is no air drag, mechanical energy is conserved and we can use equations (1) and (2) to write E 0  =  E t ⇒ k 2 x 2  =  m 2   v 2 t   + 2 mgR ⇒ K t  =   m 2   v 2 t   =  k 2 x 2  − 2 mgR.

From the information given in the problem statement we know that  N  = 2 mg , so equation (4) becomes 3 mg  =   mv 2 t R ⇒ v t  = p 3 gR. (5) 3.

Does the period of the pendulum depend on  m ? ', 'answer': 'Below is the free body diagram for the point mass of the simple pendulum in polar coordinates at an arbitrary angular position of  ϕ . We define a polar coordinate system, which is natural for describing the rotational motion of the mass. Additionally, we define a Cartesian coordinate system such that the polar angle  ϕ measures the angle from the  x  axis towards the positive  y  axis (as is conventional). m L ϕ ϕ ϕ mg T ϕ ρ x y x O 1. We can solve part one in two ways: using Newton’s second law or conservation of energy. Using Newton’s second law:  At a given angular position, the gravitational force on the point mass is given by ⃗ F g  =  mg ˆ x  =  mg \\x10 cos  ϕ ˆ ρ  − sin  ϕ ˆ ϕ \\x11 , (1) where we have related the Cartesian and polar unit vectors using the formula  ˆ x  = cos  ϕ ˆ ρ  − sin  ϕ ˆ ϕ  from lecture 4a. We can calculate the tension from the radial component of Newton’s second law using the centripetal acceleration  ⃗ a cent  =  − ( v 2 ϕ /L )ˆ ρ  to get mg  cos  ϕ  − T  =  ma cent  =  − m v 2 ϕ L ⇒ T  =  mg  cos  ϕ  +  m v 2 ϕ L  , (2) where  v ϕ  is the speed of the point mass (which is purely tangential). However, this will not be needed for to solve the problem. Instead, the tangential component of Newton’s second law is useful − mg  sin  ϕ  =  ma ϕ ⇒ − g  sin  ϕ  =  a ϕ . (3) The form of the acceleration in polar coordinates is given by ⃗ a  = \\x10 ¨ ρ  − ρ   ˙ ϕ 2 \\x11 ˆ ρ  + \\x10 ρ ¨ ϕ  + 2 ˙ ρ   ˙ ϕ \\x11 ˆ ϕ. (4) 1 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 Since  ρ  =  L  is a constant, we have  ˙ ρ  = 0  and we can substitute the tangential component of equation (4) into equation (3) to find − g  sin  ϕ  =  L d 2 ϕ dt 2 ⇒ d 2 ϕ dt 2  +  g L   sin  ϕ  = 0 . (5) Using the small angle approximation  sin  ϕ  ≈ ϕ  gives the differential equation of a simple harmonic oscillator d 2 ϕ dt 2  +  g L ϕ  = 0 . (6) Using conservation of energy:  Since all of the forces acting on the pendulum are conservative, we can impose conservation of mechanical energy E m 0  =  E mf (7) between the initial state described in the problem (denoted by the subscript  0 ) and the final state when the pendulum is at any arbitrary angular position  ϕ  (denoted by the subscript  f ). The only forces involved are gravity, so equation (7) is K 0  +  U g 0  =  K f  +  U gf . (8) The system is released from rest, so  K 0  = 0 . Additionally, we will define the reference point for the gravitational potential energy to be the origin  O  of our polar coordinate system (i.e. the location of the pivot point at the top of the string). Given the Cartesian coordinate system shown above, the gravitational potential energy of the point mass is given by U g  =  − mgx  =  − mgρ  cos  ϕ  =  − mgL  cos  ϕ, (9) where we have expressed the Cartesian coordinate  x  in polar coordinates using the formula  x  =  ρ  cos  ϕ from lecture 4a. Substituting this,  K 0  = 0 , and the form of the rotational kinetic energy  K  = ( I/ 2) ω 2 into equation (8) gives 0  − mgL  cos  ϕ 0  =   I 2 ω 2  − mgL  cos  ϕ, (10) where  ω  is the angular speed. For a point mass located a distance  ρ  =  L  away from the axis of rotation, the moment of inertia is  I  =  mL 2 . Employing this and taking the time derivative of equation (10) using the chain rule yields 0 =   mL 2 2 \\x12 2 ω  dω dt \\x13 +  mgL  sin  ϕ dϕ dt ⇒ 0 =  Lω  dω dt   +  g  sin  ϕdϕ dt  . (11) Identifying that  ω  =  dϕ/dt  produces 0 =  Lω  d 2 ϕ dt 2  +  gω  sin  ϕ ⇒ d 2 ϕ dt 2  +  g L   sin  ϕ  = 0 , (12) which is identical to equation (5). Thus, energy conservation gives the same answer as Newton’s second law. 2. The differential equation for a simple harmonic oscillator has the form d 2 ϕ dt 2  +  ω 2 0 ϕ  = 0 , (13) where  ω 0  is the angular frequency of oscillation. Thus, by comparison with equation (6), we see that ω 0  = r  g L . (14) 2 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 To get the frequency  f 0  (i.e. the number of oscillations per second) from the angular frequency (i.e. the average number of radians the object completes in its oscillation per second), we use the fact that one oscillation corresponds to  2 π  radians. This means that  ω 0  = 2 πf 0 , so f 0  =  1 2 π r  g L . (15) 3. The period is the time it takes for the object to complete a full oscillation (i.e. the number of seconds per oscillation). This is simply the inverse of the number of oscillations per second (i.e. the frequency). Thus, using  T 0  = 1 /f 0  we find the period to be T 0  = 2 π s L g  . (16) 4. The angular velocity of the point mass at a given location is easiest to calculate from conservation of energy. We can take equation (10) and let  ϕ  = 0  to choose the final state to be when the pendulum is at the bottom of its swing − mgL  cos  ϕ 0  =   I 2 ω 2  − mgL. (17) Given that  I  =  mL 2 , we can rewrite this as − mgL  cos  ϕ 0  =   mL 2 2 ω 2   − mgL ⇒ ω  = r 2   g L   (1  − cos  ϕ 0 ) . (18) The translational speed  v  =  v ϕ  is purely tangential, which is related to the angular speed  ω  through v ϕ  =  ρω. (19) Substituting equation (18) and the fact that  ρ  =  L  gives v ϕ  =  L r 2   g L   (1  − cos  ϕ 0 ) ⇒ v ϕ  = p 2 gL  (1  − cos  ϕ 0 ) . (20) 5. No, these are not the same. The angular speed  ω  =  dϕ/dt  is the rate of change in the angular position of the pendulum (where  2 π  radians corresponds to a  full circle  in our polar coordinate  ϕ ). The angular frequency  ω 0  = p g/L  represents the average number of radians the object completes per second (where 2 π  radians corresponds to a  full oscillation ). Moreover, the angular speed  ω  will change throughout the pendulum’s motion, while the angular frequency  ω 0  is defined such that it is always a constant. 6. No, as shown by equation (16).

The force   ⃗ F 1  is spring-like (i.e. proportional and opposite to ⃗ r , the displacement from the equilibrium position at the origin) and   ⃗ F 2  is a viscous friction-type force (i.e. proportional and opposite to the velocity  v ).

', 'answer': '1. We start by representing the system in polar coordinates, as shown below. Note that, until we solve the equations of motion, we don’t know the direction of  ⃗ v  and, hence,   ⃗ F 2 , so we draw it with an arbitrary direction (and include both radial and azimuthal components to be as general as possible). x y y x ρ ϕ r F  1 F  2 ϕ P O 2.

The position vector in polar coordinates is  ⃗ r  =  ρ ˆ ρ  (which does not include a   ˆ ϕ  component because the direction of the radial unit vector  ˆ ρ changes with time such that it always points at the point mass). Thus, the spring-like force can be written as ⃗ F 1  =  − mk 2   ( ρ ˆ ρ )  . The problem statement gives the form of the velocity in polar coordinates, which we can substitute to write the friction-type force as ⃗ F 2  =  − 2 mλ \\x10 ˙ ρ ˆ ρ  +  ρ   ˙ ϕ ˆ ϕ \\x11 .

Since   ˙ ϕ  ̸ = 0  and   ¨ ϕ  = 0 , the equation in the   ˆ ϕ  direction simplifies to ˙ ρ  =  − λρ. 3. Given the solution form in the problem statement, we can immediately solve the   ˆ ϕ  equation and use the initial condition  ρ (0) =  ρ 0  =  C  to find ρ  ( t ) =  ρ 0 e − λt . We can then rearrange the  ˆ ρ  equation to isolate   ˙ ϕ  according to ˙ ϕ 2   =  ¨ ρ ρ   + 2 λ  ˙ ρ ρ +  k 2 . Substituting our solution for  ρ ( t ) , we find ˙ ϕ  =  ± p k 2   − λ 2 , where we note that this is a real number as the problem statement tells us that  k > λ . Integrating this equation with respect to time and using the initial condition that  ϕ  (0) = 0  to determine the integration constant, we find ϕ  ( t ) =  ± t p k 2   − λ 2 . Solving this for  t  and substituting it into our expression for  ρ ( t )  gives ρ  ( ϕ ) =  ρ 0 e ∓ λϕ √ k 2 − λ 2   .

(14) Thus, we have N 2  =   mg √ 2 1  − µ 1 +  µ 2  , (15) which can be substituted into equation (12) to find N 1  =   mg √ 2 1 +  µ 1 +  µ 2  . (16) Note that the normal forces  N 1  and  N 2  are different. This is due to the rotation of the cylinder and the kinetic friction force. Looking at the free body diagram above, we see that it is not quite left-right mirror symmetric. Specifically, both of the kinetic friction forces point to the left. This fact means that one cannot assume that  N 1  =  N 2 . Instead one must calculate them, which indeed reveals that they are different. 5 Finally, to find the externally applied torque  ⃗ τ a , we must employ equation (2). We will choose the pivot point to be the axis of rotation of the cylinder. Thus, the torque  ⃗ τ  =  ⃗ r  ×   ⃗ F  arising from a force   ⃗ F  depends on the position vector  ⃗ r  from the axis of rotation to the point of application of the force. For the two normal forces, this is  ⃗ τ N 1  =  ⃗ r N 1  ×   ⃗ N 1  =  ⃗ τ N 2  =  ⃗ r N 2  ×   ⃗ N 2  = 0  as the cross product of parallel (or anti-parallel) vectors is zero. Additionally, since the gravitational force is applied at the center of mass of the system, its position vector is  ⃗ r g  = 0 , which means the torque it creates is  ⃗ τ g  = 0  as well. Thus, we have three non-zero torques about the axis of rotation of the cylinder: the externally applied torque  ⃗ τ a  and torques from the two frictional forces  ⃗ τ f 1  and  ⃗ τ f 2 . This means equation (2) can be written as X ⃗ τ ext  =  ⃗ τ a  +  ⃗ τ f 1  +  ⃗ τ f 2  =  ⃗ τ a  +  ⃗ r f 1  ×   ⃗ F f 1  +  ⃗ r f 2  ×   ⃗ F f 2  =  ⃗ τ a  − r f 1 F f 1 ˆ z  − r f 2 F f 2 ˆ z  = 0 , (17) where we have used the definition of a torque  ⃗ τ  =  ⃗ r  ×   ⃗ F , the fact that the frictional forces are perpendicular to the position vectors, and the right-hand rule to evaluate the direction of the cross product. Substituting the form of the frictional force as well as equations (15) and (16) gives ⃗ τ a  =  R  ( µN 1  +  µN 2 ) ˆ z  =  R \\x12 µ mg √ 2 1 +  µ 1 +  µ 2  +  µmg √ 2 1  − µ 1 +  µ 2 \\x13 ˆ z  = √ 2 mgµR 1 +  µ 2  ˆ z, (18) where we also note that the distance to the point of application of the frictional forces is  r f 1  =  r f 2  =  R .

( 2 . 0 points )  Calculate the tension in the rope  T ( ρ )  as a function of  ρ  (the radial distance from the pivot point  O p ) as well as  ϕ  (the angle of the rope) and  ω  (the instantaneous angular speed of the rope). Note that in this part you may assume the  tension is zero at the end of the rope  and include the variables  ρ ,  ϕ , and  ω  in your answer. To calculate the tension in a massive rope, we start by dividing it into differential elements and then draw the free body diagram for an arbitrary element in the middle (shown above). We will draw it at an arbitrary angular position  ϕ . From this we see that there are three forces acting on the differential element: gravity (∆ mg ), the tension force from the differential element above ( T 1 ), and the tension force from the differential element below ( T 2 ). To find how the tension changes with location, we only need to consider the forces acting  along  the rope, which is in the ˆ ρ  direction. Thus, from our free body diagram, we see that the radial component of Newton’s second law is T 2  − T 1  + ∆ mg  cos  ϕ  = ∆ ma ρ , (1) where  a ρ  is the radial component of the acceleration of the differential element. Since the rope stays straight and simply pivots around the point  O p , it is executing circular motion (though the circular motion is not uniform as  ω  is changing). We know that the radial component of the acceleration of an object executing circular motion is the centripetal acceleration  ⃗ a cent  = − ρω 2 ˆ ρ , where  ρ  is the radial location of the differential element that we are considering. We can substitute this to find ∆ T  + ∆ mg  cos  ϕ  =  − ∆ mρω 2 , (2) where we have identified the change in tension across the differential element as ∆ T  =  T 2  − T 1 . Note that there will also be a tangential component of the acceleration  a ϕ  as the rope is experiencing angular acceleration due to gravity, but this does not appear in the  radial  component of Newton’s second law. Next, we can use the density to convert the differential mass to a differential length. Since the rope has a uniform linear mass density, we know that λ  =   m ℓ = ∆ m ∆ ρ ⇒ ∆ m  =   m ℓ ∆ ρ.

(4) Now we can take the limit as ∆ ρ  → 0 to find the differential equation dT dρ   =  − mω 2 ℓ ρ  − mg ℓ cos  ϕ. (5) Integrating in  ρ  once, we find T ( ρ ) =  − mω 2 2 ℓ ρ 2  − mg ℓ ρ  cos  ϕ  +  C, (6) where  C  is the integration constant.

Thus, from Newton’s second law the acceleration of the small trolley  ⃗ a  is m⃗ g  +   ⃗ S  =  m⃗ a ⇒ ⃗ a  =  ⃗ g  + ⃗ S m . Projecting this in the  ˆ x  and  ˆ y  directions gives a x  =   S  sin  θ m and a y  =   S  cos  θ m − g. The forces on the triangular trolley are the weight  M⃗ g , the externally applied force   ⃗ F , the normal force   ⃗ T  from the ground acting on the triangular trolley, and the normal force   ⃗ Q  from the small trolley acting on the triangular trolley. We can recognize that   ⃗ S  and   ⃗ Q  are action-reaction pairs. Thus, from Newton’s third law we know that ⃗ Q  =  − ⃗ S. Using this, Newton’s second law for the triangular trolley becomes M⃗ g  +   ⃗ T  +   ⃗ F  +   ⃗ Q  =  M  ⃗ A ⇒ ⃗ A  =  ⃗ g  + ⃗ T M   + ⃗ F M   − ⃗ S M  . Projecting this in the  x  and  y  directions gives A x  =   F M   − S  sin  θ M and A y  =  − g  +   T M   − S  cos  θ M , where  F  and  T  are the norms of   ⃗ F  and   ⃗ T  respectively. Since the triangular trolley is not accelerating vertically, we can take  A y  = 0  to show that T  =  Mg  +  S  cos  θ. We want to find the force that leaves the small trolley immobile on the larger one, so we require A x  =  a x A y  =  a y , which corresponds to F M   − S  sin  θ M =   S  sin  θ m 0 =   S  cos  θ m − g respectively. From the second equation we see that S  =   mg cos  θ , which can be substituted into the first to find the final answer, F  =  g  ( M  +  m ) tan  θ. ', 'course': 'Physique meca'}]\n"

It requires work (typically in the form of electrical energy) to do this. Most refrigerators employ a thermodynamic cycle with refrigerant circulating around a loop. As the refrigerant circulates around the loop, its internal energy (and temperature) is alternately raised and lowered by a series of devices. First the internal energy is lowered either by passing through a small turbine or through an expansion valve. In these devices, work is done by the refrigerant so its internal energy is lowered. The internal energy is lowered to a point where the temperature of the refrigerant is lower than that of the air in the refrigerator. A heat exchanger is used to transfer energy from the air (and food) in the refrigerator to the cold refrigerant (energy transferred by virtue of a temperature difference only = heat). This lowers the internal energy of the air/food and raises the internal energy of the refrigerant. Then a pump or compressor is used to do work on the refrigerant adding additional energy to it and thus further raising its internal energy. Electrical energy is used to drive the pump or compressor. The internal energy of the refrigerant is raised to a point where its temperature is hotter than the temperature of the room. The refrigerant is then passed through a heat exchanger (the coils at the back of the refrigerator) so that energy is transferred from the refrigerant to the surroundings. As a result, the internal energy of the refrigerant is reduced and the internal energy of the surroundings is increased. It is at this point where the internal energy of the food and the energy used to drive the compressor or pump are transferred to the surroundings. The refrigerant then continues on to the turbine, repeating the cycle.', 'subject': 'Unified Engineering 1 and 2'}, {'question': 'Find the change in entropy if 500 g of water at 80 °C is added to 300 g of water at 20 °C.', 'answer': '3.20 cal/K', 'subject': 'Fundamentals of Physics I'}, {'question': 'If the stack pointer is 0xFFF22378 and the computer pushes 4 4-byte words onto the stack (which is growing down), what is the resulting stack pointer in hexadecimal?', 'answer': '0xFFF22368', 'subject': 'Computer Architecture'}, {'question': 'Consider the smooth function \\\\psi(x) = N/2 * ( \\\\tanh( (x + a/2)/b ) - \\\\tanh( (x - a/2)/b ) ), Sketch \\\\psi(x) for various values of b to convince yourself that ψ7b(x) well approximates ψ7(x) as b → 0.

What speed should the model be tested at to determine the necessary thrust on\\nthe full-scale vehicle?
