       "  'answer': '1. In an elastic collision, both the mechanical energy and momentum are conserved. Conservation of momentum in one dimension is m 1 v 1 i  +  m 2 v 2 i  =  m 1 v 1 f  +  m 2 v 2 f , (1) where the subscripts  i  and  f  indicate the state just before and just after the collision respectively and the subscripts  1  and  2  indicate the first or second ball respectively. Since the first ball has an initial speed of  v 1 i  =  v 0  and the second ball starts at rest  v 2 i  = 0 , equation (1) becomes m 1 v 0  =  m 1 v 1 f  +  m 2 v 2 f . (2) Solving this equation for the final velocity of the first ball gives v 1 f  =  v 0  − m 2 m 1 v 2 f . (3) We chose to solve for  v 1 f , rather than  v 2 f  because we are searching for  v 2 f  and substituting equation (3) into the conservation of energy equation will allow us to eliminate  v 1 f . Since the collision is elastic, mechanical energy is conserved during the collision and we can write m 1 2   v 2 1 i   +  m 2 2   v 2 2 i   =  m 1 2   v 2 1 f   +  m 2 2   v 2 2 f . (4) Given the initial velocities of the two balls, this becomes m 1 2   v 2 0   =  m 1 2   v 2 1 f   +  m 2 2   v 2 2 f . (5) Substituting equation (3) into equation (5) allows us to eliminate  v 1 f  and gives m 1 2   v 2 0   =  m 1 2 \\x12 v 0  − m 2 m 1 v 2 f \\x13 2 +   m 2 2   v 2 2 f (6) m 1 2   v 2 0   =  m 1 2 \\x12 v 2 0   − 2 v 0 m 2 m 1 v 2 f  +   m 2 2 m 2 1 v 2 2 f \\x13 +   m 2 2   v 2 2 f (7) m 1 2   v 2 0   =  m 1 2   v 2 0   − 2 v 0 m 2 2   v 2 f  +  m 2 2 m 2 m 1 v 2 2 f   +  m 2 2   v 2 2 f (8) 0 =  − 2 v 0 m 2 2   v 2 f  + \\x12 m 2 m 1 + 1 \\x13  m 2 2   v 2 2 f (9) \\x12 m 1  +  m 2 m 1 \\x13 v 2 f  = 2 v 0 (10) v 2 f  = 2 m 1 m 1  +  m 2 v 0 . (11) 1 Collisions - Solutions to Problem Set 10 To calculate the maximum height attained by the second ball after the collision, we can use conservation of mechanical energy. Since there are no non-conservative forces doing work, we have K 2 f  +  U 2 f  =  K 2 max  +  U 2 max , (12) where  K 2 max  and  U 2 max  are the kinetic and gravitational potential energies at the maximum height. Given that it is the maximum height, we know that  K 2 max  = 0 . Additionally, we can define the reference point for the gravitational potential to be at the height of the collision. Thus,  U 2 f  = 0 , implying that equation (12) becomes K 2 f  + 0 = 0 +  U 2 max ⇒ m 2 2   v 2 2 f   =  m 2 gh max ⇒ h max  =  1 2 g  v 2 2 f . (13) Substituting equation (11) gives h max  =  1 2 g \\x12 2 m 1 m 1  +  m 2 v 0 \\x13 2 =  2 g \\x12 m 1 m 1  +  m 2 \\x13 2 v 2 0 . (14) Plugging in numbers, we find that h max  = 2 . 22  cm . (15) 2. In this case momentum is still conserved, but mechanical energy is not. Thus, equation (2) still remains valid. However, since the objects stick together after the collision, we know that  v 1 f  =  v 2 f  =  v f . Substituting this constraint into equation (2) gives m 1 v 0  =  m 1 v f  +  m 2 v f ⇒ v f  = m 1 m 1  +  m 2 v 0 . (16) Even though mechanical energy is not conserved by the collision (due to the non-conservative frictional forces involved in two objects sticking together), it is conserved  after  the collision. Thus, we have K f  +  U f  =  K max  +  U max (17) for the combined object with mass  m 1  +  m 2 . As before, we can define the reference point for the gravitational potential to be at the height of the collision and find K f  + 0 = 0 +  U max ⇒ m 1  +  m 2 2 v 2 f   = ( m 1   +  m 2 )  gh max ⇒ h max  =  1 2 g  v 2 f . (18) Substituting equation (16) produces h max  =  1 2 g \\x12 m 1 m 1  +  m 2 \\x13 2 v 2 0 . (19) Plugging in numbers gives h max  = 0 . 56  cm , (20) which is a factor of  4  lower than for the elastic collision. This is due to the negative work that non- conservative forces do on the system during the inelastic collision. Ultimately, this lost energy becomes heat. 2 Collisions - Solutions to Problem Set 10 ',\n",

       " {'question': 'Two balls of mass  m 1  and  m 2  are released with no initial velocity from a height  h  as shown below. Ball 1 is directly beneath ball 2 and they are touching. During their fall, the balls stay in contact until they hit the ground. The situation can be described as an elastic collision between ball 1 and the ground, immediately followed by a collision between the two balls. Note that you can assume the radii of the balls are negligibly small, as is air drag. Answer all the questions below for both of the following cases: 1. The collision between the two balls is perfectly elastic 2. The collision between the two balls is inelastic and they stick together a) What are the velocities of each ball immediately after the second collision? b) What is the condition between  m 1  and  m 2  for the balls to both attain an upwards velocity? c) What is the condition between  m 1  and  m 2  for the first ball to stay on the ground? d) What is the maximum height  h 2 max  attained by the second ball if  m 1  ≫ m 2 ? 1 Collisions - Problem Set 10 g y h m 1 m 2 ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'For this problem, we will decompose the situation into four successive parts: the projectile motion of the descent, then the collision between ball 1 and the ground, then the collision between ball 1 and ball 2, and finally the projectile motion of the ascent. 1.a)  Projectile motion of the descent:  Before the first collision, both balls experience projectile motion. By conservation of mechanical energy during the entire fall, we have 0 +  m 1 gh  =   m 1 2   v 2 1 f   + 0 and 0 +  m 2 gh  =   m 2 2   v 2 2 f   + 0 , (1) where we will define  y  = 0  to be the ground and let  ˆ y  point upwards (as shown in the problem statement). Solving both these equations for the velocity just before impact with the ground v 1 f  =  v 2 f  =  ± p 2 gh  =  − p 2 gh  =  − v ⇒ v  = p 2 gh (2) reveals that it is the same for both balls (which is expected as we know that objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass). We chose the negative sign as we know that both balls are falling downwards in the  − ˆ y  direction. Additionally, we chose to define a new parameter  v  such that it is positive. Collision between ball 1 and the ground:  Next, ball 1 experiences an elastic collision with the ground. We have the intuition that the ball will maintain its speed and reverse its direction as a result of the collision, but this can be demonstrated rigorously. We start by writing requiring conservation of momentum m 1 v 1 i  +  M E v Ei  =  m 1 v 1 f  +  M E v Ef , (3) where the subscript  E  refers to the earth. We know that  v Ei  = 0  (given that we have taken a laboratory reference frame) and the velocity of ball 1 just before the collision is equal to its final velocity after projectile motion (i.e. equation (2)). Thus, we can find − m 1 v  + 0 =  m 1 v 1 f  +  M E v Ef ⇒ v Ef  =  − m 1 M E ( v  +  v 1 f )  . (4) Since the collision is elastic, we can also enforce conservation of mechanical energy m 1 2   v 2  + 0 =  m 1 2   v 2 1 f   +  M E 2   v 2 Ef . (5) Substituting equation (4) shows that m 1 2   v 2  =  m 1 2   v 2 1 f   +  M E 2 \\x12  m 1 M E ( v  +  v 1 f ) \\x13 2 ⇒ m 1 2 \\x00 v 2   − v 2 1 f \\x01 =   m 1 M E m 1 2  ( v  +  v 1 f ) 2  . (6) Crucially, we see that the right-hand side of the equation has a factor of  m 1 /M E , while the left-hand side does not. Since the earth is  much  more massive than the ball, we know that  m 1 /M E  ≪ 1  and we can neglect the right-hand side of the equation. Thus, we find that ball 1 has a velocity of m 1 2 \\x00 v 2   − v 2 1 f \\x01 = 0 ⇒ v 2 1 f   =  v 2  = 2 gh ⇒ v 1 f  =  ± p 2 gh  = p 2 gh  =  v (7) after colliding with the ground, where we’ve used equation (2) and chosen the plus sign (as the ball must change direction to avoid passing through the earth). Thus, we’ve found that, before the two balls collide, ball 1 has a velocity of  v  =   √ 2 gh , while ball 2 still has a velocity of  − v  =  − √ 2 gh . Collision between ball 1 and ball 2:  Now the two balls collide elastically with one another. In class, we derived the general formulas for the velocities that result from an elastic collision between two 3 Collisions - Solutions to Problem Set 10 objects in one dimension. This derivation was streamlined to minimize the math, but was not intuitive. You are free to simply use the formulas we found. Here we present a more intuitive derivation that, as a result, is considerably more messy (even for the case considered here of identical initial speeds). Enforcing conservation of momentum and using the final velocities from the previous part gives m 1 v 1 i  + m 2 v 2 i  =  m 1 v 1 f  + m 2 v 2 f ⇒ m 1 v  − m 2 v  =  m 1 v 1 f  + m 2 v 2 f ⇒ v 1 f  =   m 1  − m 2 m 1 v  − m 2 m 1 v 2 f . (8) Since the collision is elastic, we enforce conservation of mechanical energy m 1 2   v 2 1 i   +  m 2 2   v 2 2 i   =  m 1 2   v 2 1 f   +  m 2 2   v 2 2 f ⇒ m 1  +  m 2 2 v 2   =   m 1 2   v 2 1 f   +  m 2 2   v 2 2 f . (9) Substituting equation (8) and simplifying produces m 1  +  m 2 2 v 2   =   m 1 2 \\x12 m 1  − m 2 m 1 v  − m 2 m 1 v 2 f \\x13 2 +   m 2 2   v 2 2 f (10) ( m 1  +  m 2 )  v 2   =  m 1   ( m 1  − m 2 ) 2 m 2 1 v 2   − 2 m 1 m 2  − m 2 2 m 2 1 vv 2 f  +   m 2 2 m 2 1 v 2 2 f ! +  m 2 v 2 2 f (11) \\x00 m 2 1   +  m 1 m 2 \\x01 v 2   = \\x00 m 2 1   − 2 m 1 m 2   +  m 2 2 \\x01 v 2   − 2 \\x00 m 1 m 2  − m 2 2 \\x01 vv 2 f  +  m 2 2 v 2 2 f   +  m 1 m 2 v 2 2 f (12) 0 = \\x00 m 2 2   − 3 m 1 m 2 \\x01 v 2   − 2 \\x00 m 1 m 2  − m 2 2 \\x01 vv 2 f  + \\x00 m 2 2   +  m 1 m 2 \\x01 v 2 2 f . (13) Applying the quadratic formula gives v 2 f  = 2 \\x00 m 1 m 2  − m 2 2 \\x01 v  ± q 4 ( m 1 m 2  − m 2 2 ) 2  v 2  − 4 ( m 2 2   +  m 1 m 2 ) ( m 2 2   − 3 m 1 m 2 )  v 2 2 ( m 2 2   +  m 1 m 2 ) (14) v 2 f  =  v  m 1 m 2  − m 2 2   ± p ( m 2 1 m 2 2   − 2 m 1 m 3 2   +  m 4 2 )  − ( m 4 2   +  m 1 m 3 2   − 3 m 1 m 3 2   − 3 m 2 1 m 2 2 ) m 2 2   +  m 1 m 2 (15) v 2 f  =  v  m 1 m 2  − m 2 2   ±  2 m 1 m 2 m 2 2   +  m 1 m 2 =  v  m 1  − m 2  ±  2 m 1 m 1  +  m 2 =  v   (1  ±  2)  m 1  − m 2 m 1  +  m 2 . (16) We see that the solution with the minus sign gives  v 2 f  =  − v , which is identical to the initial velocity of ball 2. Thus, the physical solution must be the plus sign, which gives v 2 f  =  v   3 m 1  − m 2 m 1  +  m 2 = p 2 gh 3 m 1  − m 2 m 1  +  m 2 (17) using equation (2). Inserting this result into equation (8) allows us to find the velocity of ball 1 to be v 1 f  =   m 1  − m 2 m 1 v  − m 2 m 1 \\x12 v   3 m 1  − m 2 m 1  +  m 2 \\x13 = v m 1 \\x12 m 1  − m 2  +   m 2 2   − 3 m 1 m 2 m 1  +  m 2 \\x13 (18) v 1 f  = v m 1 \\x12 ( m 1  − m 2 ) ( m 1  +  m 2 ) m 1  +  m 2 +   m 2 2   − 3 m 1 m 2 m 1  +  m 2 \\x13 = v m 1 m 2 1   − 3 m 1 m 2 m 1  +  m 2 (19) v 1 f  =  v  m 1  − 3 m 2 m 1  +  m 2 = p 2 gh m 1  − 3 m 2 m 1  +  m 2 . (20) using equation (2). 1.b) In order for both balls to bounce off the ground upwards, we require that v f 1  >  0 and v f 2  >  0 . (21) 4 Collisions - Solutions to Problem Set 10 Using equations (17) and (20), this gives the conditions that m 1  >  3 m 2  and  3 m 1  > m 2 (22) respectively. If the first is satisfied, the second will also be. Thus, for both balls to bounce upwards we require that m 1  >  3 m 2 . (23) 1.c) Ball 1 will end up immobile on the ground if  v 1 f  = 0 . From equation (20), we that this will occur when  m 1  = 3 m 2 . If  m 1  <  3 m 2  the first ball will travel downwards and collide with the ground again. 1.d)  Projectile motion of the ascent:  After the balls collide, they again experience projectile motion. In the limit that  m 1  ≫ m 2 , equation (17) shows that the initial velocity of ball 2 during this stage is v 2 i  = 3 v. (24) There are no non-conservative forces, so we can apply conservation of mechanical energy. At its maximum, ball 2 will have no kinetic energy and we can define the reference point for the gravitational potential energy to be the ground. Thus, we have m 2 2   v 2 2 i   + 0 = 0 +  m 2 gh 2 max ⇒ h 2 max  =  1 2 g  v 2 2 i . (25) Substituting equations (2) and (24) give the final answer of h 2 max  =  9 2 g  v 2  = 9 h. (26) 2.a) The  projectile motion of the descent  and the  collision between ball 1 and the ground  remain unchanged. Collision between ball 1 and ball 2:  The difference only arises when the two balls collide as the collision is now purely inelastic. This means that kinetic energy is not conserved. Momentum is still conserved, but, since the two balls stick together, we know that  v 1 f  =  v 2 f  =  v f . Thus, equation (8) is replaced by m 1 v 1 i  +  m 2 v 2 i  =  m 1 v f  +  m 2 v f ⇒ m 1 v  − m 2 v  = ( m 1  +  m 2 )  v f ⇒ v f  =   m 1  − m 2 m 1  +  m 2 v. (27) Substituting equation (2) gives the final answer of v f  =   m 1  − m 2 m 1  +  m 2 p 2 gh (28) 2.b) For the two balls to go upwards, the final velocity  v f  >  0  must be positive. Using equation (28), we see that this occurs when  m 1  > m 2 . 2.c) Ball 1 will end up immobile on the ground if  v 1 f  =  v f  = 0 . From equation (28), we that this will occur when  m 1  =  m 2 . If  m 1  < m 2  the first ball will travel downwards and collide with the ground again. 2.d)  Projectile motion of the ascent:  In the limit that  m 1  ≫ m 2 , equation (28) becomes v f  = p 2 gh. (29) Since the two balls undergo projectile motion together after the collision. We can apply conservation of energy between the ground and the point of maximum height according to m 1  +  m 2 2 v 2 f   + 0 = 0 + ( m 1   +  m 2 ) gh 2 max .

The recoil of the cannon is absorbed by a spring with a stiffness of  k  = 10 5   N/m that is at its equilibrium position before the shot is fired. Neglect friction, air drag, and small variations in gravitational potential energy due to the cannon’s motion. 1. How far does the spring compress during the shot? 2. What was the energy delivered by the explosion of the powder in the cannon? ',\n",
       "  'answer': '1. As a result of the explosion, the entire cannon moves backwards and the spring compresses. The energy of the system is comprised of kinetic  K  and spring potential energy  U s . We will ignore any small change in the elevation of the cannon, thereby neglecting the gravitational potential energy  U g . Given that energy is always conserved, we have K i  +  U si  =  K f  +  U sf . (1) We will take the initial state to be the moment immediately after the explosion, when the cannon is moving at its maximum speed  V 0 , but the spring is still at its equilibrium position. For the final state, we will take the moment when the spring has its maximum displacement  ∆ x max  and the cannon has come to a temporary rest. Thus, equation (1) becomes M 2   V  2 0   + 0 = 0 +  k 2 ∆ x 2 max ⇒ ∆ x max  = r M k  V 0 . (2) Unfortunately, we do not know the initial speed of the cannon  V 0 . To find this, we must use the information given in the problem statement about the dynamics of the cannonball. To relate the dynamics of the cannon to that of the cannonball, we can use conservation of momentum. Given that the cannon-cannonball system is initially at rest, conservation of momentum is 0 =  mv 0 ˆ u  − MV 0 ˆ u ⇒ V 0  =   m M  v 0 , (3) where  v 0  is the initial velocity of the cannonball and the  ˆ u  direction is defined in the diagram above. Substituting this into equation (2) yields ∆ x max  = m √ kM v 0 . (4) 6 Collisions - Solutions to Problem Set 10 To find the velocity  v 0 , we can use the equations of projectile motion x ( t ) =  v 0 x t  +  x 0 (5) y ( t ) =  − g 2 t 2  +  v 0 y t  +  y 0 , (6) where we have defined a Cartesian coordinate system as shown in the diagram above. We will define the origin of the coordinate system to be the cannon, such that the cannonball is at  x 0  = 0  and y 0  = 0  when the cannon fires at  t  = 0 . Given the information in the problem statement, we know that v 0 x  =  v 0  cos  α  and  v 0 y  =  v 0  sin  α . Thus, equations (5) and (6) become x ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  α (7) y ( t ) =  − g 2 t 2  +  v 0 t  sin  α. (8) At some time  t  =  t f , we know that the cannonball will land at the location x ( t f ) =  P  =  v 0 t f  cos  α ⇒ t f  = P v 0  cos  α (9) y ( t f ) = 0 =  − g 2 t 2 f   +  v 0 t f   sin  α ⇒ 0 =  − g 2 t f  +  v 0  sin  α ⇒ t f  =  2 g  v 0  sin  α. (10) Equating equations (9) and (10) gives P v 0  cos  α   = 2 g  v 0  sin  α ⇒ v 0  = r gP 2 sin  α  cos  α . (11) Substituting this into equation (4) gives the final answer of ∆ x max  = m √ kM r gP 2 sin  α  cos  α . (12) Plugging in the numerical values from the problem statement gives ∆ x max  = 0 . 2  m , (13) where we note that  M  = 10  tons  = 10 4   kg. 2. The energy delivered by the explosion is equal to the energy imparted to the cannon and the cannonball combined. From equation (2), we see that we can represent the total energy of the cannon by its maximum spring potential energy  U sf  = ( k/ 2)∆ x 2 max . On the other hand, the total energy of the cannonball is just its initial kinetic energy  K i  = ( m/ 2) v 2 0 . Thus, we have E tot  =   k 2 ∆ x 2 max   +  m 2   v 2 0   =  k 2 ∆ x 2 max   +  m 2 gP 2 sin  α  cos  α , (14) where we have used equation (11).

       " {'question': 'A projectile of mass  m  is fired vertically from the earth’s surface with an initial velocity that is equal to the  escape velocity . The escape velocity is defined as the minimum velocity that is required for an object to escape the gravitational field of a celestial body (e.g. the earth). It satisfies the condition that the total mechanical energy (i.e. kinetic plus gravitational potential) is equal to zero. When the projectile is a distance  2 R e  from the center of the earth, it collides with a satellite of mass  m  that is orbiting the earth in a circle. After the collision the two objects stick together. Assume that the collision is instantaneous, neglect atmospheric drag, and let the reference point for the gravitational potential be at infinite distance. Express your answers to the questions below in terms of  m , the radius of the earth  R e , the mass of the earth M e , and the universal gravitational constant  G . 2 Collisions - Problem Set 10 1. What is the initial speed of the projectile when it is launched from the surface of the earth? 2. What is the speed of the projectile just before the collision, when it is a distance  2 R e  from the center of the earth? 3. What is the speed of the satellite just before the collision, when it is in a circular orbit of radius  2 R e ? 4. What is the speed of projectile and satellite immediately after the collision? ',\n",
       "  'answer': '7 Collisions - Solutions to Problem Set 10 1. The initial speed of the projectile is equal to the magnitude of its escape velocity. Given the definition of escape velocity, this can be found from the condition that K 0  +  U G 0  = 0 , (1) where the subscript  0  indicates the initial value and  U G  indicates the general gravitational potential (which is distinct from the gravitational potential near the earth’s surface  U g  =  mgy ). We can calculate U G  from the form of the gravitational force between the two objects ⃗ F G ( r ) =  − GmM e r 2 ˆ r. (2) Choosing to use a spherical coordinate system, the change in the potential energy due to the force   ⃗ F G is ∆ U G  =  U G ( R )  − U G ( ∞ ) =  − Z C ⃗ F G  ·  d ⃗ l  =  − Z C \\x12 − GmM e r 2 ˆ r \\x13 · \\x10 dr ˆ r  +  rdθ ˆ θ  +  r  sin  θdϕ ˆ ϕ \\x11 = Z C \\x12 GmM e r 2 \\x13 dr, (3) where the integration path  C  is along any path from  r  =  ∞ to  r  =  R . However, we see that, since the force is purely radial, only the change in radial position matters. Thus, we can write ∆ U G  =  U G ( R )  − U G ( ∞ ) = Z  R ∞ GmM e r 2 dr. (4) Taking the integral gives a potential energy difference of ∆ U G  =  U G ( R )  − U G ( ∞ ) = \\x12 − GmM e r \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c \\x0c R ∞ =  − GmM e R . (5) Since the reference point for the potential energy is at  R  =  ∞ (i.e. we define the potential energy such that  U ( ∞ ) = 0 ), equation (5) implies that U G ( R ) =  − GmM e R . (6) Substituting this into equation (1) allows us to find the initial speed of the projectile when it is launched m 2   v 2 0   − GmM e R e = 0 ⇒ v 0  = r 2 GM e R e , (7) where  R  =  R e  is the initial position. 2. Since all the forces are conservative, mechanical energy is conserved and we have K c  +  U Gc  =  K 0  +  U G 0 , (8) where the subscript  c  indicates the value just before the collision. Therefore, we can use equations (1) and (6) to write equation (8) as K c  +  U Gc  = 0 ⇒ m 2   v 2 c   − GmM e 2 R e = 0 ⇒ v c  = r GM e R e (9) at the location just before the collision  R c  = 2 R e . 8 Collisions - Solutions to Problem Set 10 3. Drawing a free body diagram for the satellite and using the gravitational force given by equation (2), we see that Newton’s second law in the  ˆ r  direction is − GmM e (2 R e ) 2  =  − m \\x12  v 2 s 2 R e \\x13 , (10) where we have used the form of the centripetal acceleration and  v s  is the speed of the satellite. Solving this equation for the speed gives v s  = r GM e 2 R e . (11) 4. Given the the collision happens quickly, we can use the impulse approximation to ignore the effect of gravity  during  the collision. Thus, momentum is conserved throughout the collision, so we can write m⃗ v pi  +  m⃗ v si  =  m⃗ v pf  +  m⃗ v sf ⇒ ⃗ v pi  +  ⃗ v si  =  ⃗ v pf  +  ⃗ v sf , (12) where the subscript  p  indicates the projectile, the subscript  s  indicates the satellite, the subscript i  indicates the value just before the collision, and the subscript  f  indicates the value just after the collision. Since the collision is purely inelastic and the objects stick together, instead of conservation of energy, we require that the final velocities of the projectile and satellite be the same ⃗ v pf  =  ⃗ v sf  =  ⃗ v f . (13) We will adopt a polar coordinate system, such that the projectile is moving in the  ˆ r  direction before the collision and the satellite is moving in the   ˆ ϕ  direction before the collision. From our solutions to parts 2 and 3 of this problem, we see that  ⃗ v pi  =  v c ˆ r  = p GM e /R e ˆ r  and  ⃗ v si  =  v s   ˆ ϕ  = p GM e / (2 R e ) ˆ ϕ . Substituting these initial values and equation (13) into equation (12), we find the final velocity of the combined projectile-satellite object to be r GM e R e ˆ r  + r GM e 2 R e ˆ ϕ  = 2 ⃗ v f ⇒ ⃗ v f  =  1 2  r GM e R e ˆ r  + r GM e 2 R e ˆ ϕ ! .

       "  'answer': 'We start by considering a single particle as it collides with the surface. The change in its momentum due to the collision is given by ∆ ⃗ p  =  ⃗ p f  − ⃗ p i  =  − mv ˆ x  − mv ˆ x  =  − 2 mv ˆ x, (1) where we have defined the  ˆ x  direction to point to the right. This change in momentum is related to the force of the wall on the particle   ⃗ F wp  through the impulse, which is given by ∆ ⃗ p  =   ⃗ I  = Z  t f t i ⃗ F wp dt. (2) 9 Collisions - Solutions to Problem Set 10 Since we only care about the average force (and not the details about how it changes with time), we can model the impulse as an average force applied over the same time interval according to ⃗ I  = Z  t f t i ⃗ F wp dt  =   ⃗ F   avg wp   ( t f   − t i ) =  ⃗ F   avg wp   ∆ t, (3) where the time interval  ∆ t  =  t f  − t i  is the time between successive particles hitting the wall. This time interval  ∆ t  is straightforward to calculate as the particles are a distance  d  apart and travel at a constant velocity of  v . Thus, immediately after one hits, the time before the next one hits will be equal to the time it takes a particle to travel a distance  d . This gives d  =  v ∆ t ⇒ ∆ t  =   d v  . (4) Substituting equations (1), (3), and (4) into equation (2) gives − 2 mv ˆ x  =   ⃗ F   avg wp   ∆ t ⇒ − 2 mv ˆ x  =   ⃗ F   avg wp \\x12 d v \\x13 ⇒ ⃗ F   avg wp   =  − 2 mv 2 d ˆ x. (5) By Newton’s third law, the force exerted by the wall on the particles has the same magnitude as the force of the particles on the wall. Thus, we find that F   avg pw   = 2 mv 2 d . (6) 10 ',\n",

What is the maximum possible angle  α m  before the foot of the ladder begins to slip and the ladder falls down? How does it depend on  m ? ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'The forces acting on the ladder are • its weight   ⃗ F g  =  − mg ˆ y  applied at the ladder’s center of mass, • the normal force of the ground   ⃗ N 1  =  N 1 ˆ y  applied at the point of contact between the ladder and the ground, • the normal force of the wall   ⃗ N 2  =  N 2 ˆ x  applied at the point of contact between the ladder and the wall, and • the friction force between the ladder and the ground   ⃗ F f  =  − F f  ˆ x  applied at the point of contact between the ladder and the ground.

In this case, Newton’s second law (for the extended system composed of the entire ladder) can be written as X  ⃗ F  =  m⃗ a ⇒ m⃗ g  +   ⃗ N 1  +   ⃗ N 2  +   ⃗ F f  = 0 . (1) 1 Rigid body rotation and static equilibrium - Solutions to Problem Set 11 Projecting this into the  ˆ x  and  ˆ y  directions gives N 2  − F f  = 0 ⇒ N 2  =  F f (2) and N 1  − mg  = 0 ⇒ N 1  =  mg (3) respectively. Equations (2) and (3) represent a system of two equations, but we have three unknowns:  N 1 ,  N 2 , and  F f (we know the maximum value of the friction force is  F   max f =  µN 1 , but we don’t know how  F f  depends on α ). To solve the problem, we must consider the torque on the ladder  ⃗ τ  =  ⃗ r  ×   ⃗ F . In equilibrium, the ladder does not turn, so the net torque must be zero. We choose the center of mass of the ladder (i.e. the origin in the above diagram) to be the pivot point. Then, we write down the net torque about this point from all the forces in the problem ⃗ τ net  = X ⃗ τ  =  ⃗ r g  ×   ⃗ F g  +  ⃗ r N 1  ×   ⃗ N 1  +  ⃗ r N 2  ×   ⃗ N 2  +  ⃗ r f  ×   ⃗ F f  = 0 , (4) where the position vectors go  from  the pivot point  to  the point of application of the force (as shown in the above diagram). Given that the position vector for the gravitational force is  ⃗ r g  = 0 , we find ⃗ r N 1  ×   ⃗ N 1  +  ⃗ r N 2  ×   ⃗ N 2  +  ⃗ r f  ×   ⃗ F f  = 0 . (5) The magnitude of all the other position vectors is  | ⃗ r N 1 |  =  | ⃗ r N 2 |  =  | ⃗ r f |  =  L/ 2 . Using the right-hand rule for the cross product, we can determine the direction of each term in equation (5). Each one is in the  ˆ z direction, however the sign is positive for   ⃗ N 1  and negative for   ⃗ F f  and   ⃗ N 2 . Next, we can use the cross product definition that   ⃗ A  ×   ⃗ B  =  |   ⃗ A ||   ⃗ B |  sin  θ  =  AB  sin  θ  (where  θ  is the angle between   ⃗ A  and   ⃗ B ).

(6) Using the trigonometric identity that  sin ( π/ 2  − α ) = cos  α  gives N 1  sin  α  − N 2  cos  α  − F f  cos  α  = 0 . (7) This is the third equation that we need to solve our system of equations. Thus, we substitute equations (2) and (3) to obtain mg  sin  α  − F f  cos  α  − F f  cos  α  = 0 ⇒ F f  =   mg 2  tan  α. (8) The static friction will be able to restrain the ladder as long as F F r  < F   max F r =  µN 1  =  µmg, (9) where we have used equation (3). Substituting equation (8) into equation (9) allows us to determine the maximum angle for which the ladder does not fall down to be tan  α m  = 2 µ ⇒ α m  = arctan(2 µ ) . (10) This condition is independent of the mass of the ladder  m . ',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Since there are no nonconservative forces in the problem, we can impose conservation of mechanical energy on the entire system (i.e. car, counterweight, and pulley) and write E mi  =  E mf , (1) where the  i  subscript indicates the state just before the funicular is released and the  f  subscript indicates the state after the car has moved a distance  d . We will quantify the positions of the car and counterweight ( x 2  and  y 1  respectively) using the coordinate systems shown in the diagram below. 2 Rigid body rotation and static equilibrium - Solutions to Problem Set 11 θ R m 1 m 2 m p x 2 y 1 We will choose the reference point for the gravitational potential energy to be at the height of the center of the pulley, which we see is at  x 2  = 0  and  y 1  = 0 . The initial mechanical energy is only the gravitational potential energy of the car and counterweight (as the center of mass of the pulley is at the reference point of the gravitational potential). Thus, we have E mi  =  U gi  =  − m 1 gy 1 i  − m 2 gx 2 i  sin  θ, (2) where  y 1 i  is the initial position of the counterweight and  x 2 i  is the initial position of the car. After the cart has moved by a distance  d , the mechanical energy is composed of the gravitational potential energy of the car and counterweight, the translational kinetic energy of the car and counterweight, and the rotational kinetic energy of the pulley. This can be written as E mf  =  U gf  +  K f  = ( − m 1 gy 1  − m 2 gx 2  sin  θ ) + \\x12 m 1 2   v 2 1   +  m 2 2   v 2 2   +  I p 2   ω 2 \\x13 , (3) where  x 2  and  y 1  are the locations of the car and counterweight respectively,  v 1  and  v 2  are the speeds of the counterweight and car respectively, and  ω  is the angular speed of the pulley. Since the rope is inextensible and directly connects the two blocks, the car and the counterweight (as well as every point of the rope) move at the same speed. This is the constraint condition, which is expressed as v  =  v 1  =  v 2 . (4) Since the rope does not slip on the pulley, the points on the outer rim of the pulley move with a tangential speed  v ϕ  equal to the speed of the rope, car, and counterweight v ϕ  =  Rω  =  v ⇒ ω  =   v R .

We see that gravity ⃗ F g  =  − mg ˆ y (3) 4 Rigid body rotation and static equilibrium - Solutions to Problem Set 11 acts on the system. Additionally, at both points of contact with the V-groove there is a normal force ⃗ N 1  =  N 1  sin  θ ˆ x  +  N 1  cos  θ ˆ y (4) ⃗ N 2  =  − N 2  sin  θ ˆ x  +  N 2  cos  θ ˆ y (5) and a kinetic friction force ⃗ F f 1  =  − F f 1  cos  θ ˆ x  +  F f 1  sin  θ ˆ y (6) ⃗ F f 2  =  − F f 2  cos  θ ˆ x  − F f 2  sin  θ ˆ y. (7) The external torque  ⃗ τ a  does not appear. This is because a torque alone exerts no net translational force on the system. In other words, a torque is composed of a set of forces that impart rotational motion, but no translational motion (because the arrangement of forces are such that they cancel when summed). An example of such a set of forces is the two green forces with magnitude  F a  in the above figure. These would create a torque  ⃗ τ a , but not affect the translational motion. Substituting the five forces from equations (3) through (7) into equation (1) gives N 1  sin  θ  − N 2  sin  θ  − F f 1  cos  θ  − F f 2  cos  θ  = 0 (8) in the  ˆ x  direction and − mg  +  N 1  cos  θ  +  N 2  cos  θ  +  F f 1  sin  θ  − F f 2  sin  θ  = 0 (9) in the  ˆ y  direction. We can substitute the form of the magnitude of the kinetic friction force  F f  =  µN  to find N 1  (sin  θ  − µ  cos  θ )  − N 2  (sin  θ  +  µ  cos  θ ) = 0 ⇒ N 1  =  N 2 tan  θ  +  µ tan  θ  − µ (10) N 1  (cos  θ  +  µ  sin  θ ) +  N 2  (cos  θ  − µ  sin  θ ) =  mg ⇒ N 1 1 +  µ  tan  θ 1  − µ  tan  θ   +  N 2  = mg cos  θ  − µ  sin  θ (11) respectively. To simplify the math we will use the fact that  θ  = 45 ◦ (though this can be introduced at any point in the problem). Equations (10) and (11) become N 1  =  N 2 1 +  µ 1  − µ (12) N 1 1 +  µ 1  − µ   +  N 2  = √ 2 mg 1  − µ  . (13) We can substitute equation (12) into equation (13) to find \\x12 N 2 1 +  µ 1  − µ \\x13  1 +  µ 1  − µ   +  N 2  = √ 2 mg 1  − µ ⇒ N 2   (1 +  µ ) 2 (1  − µ ) 2  + 1 ! = √ 2 mg 1  − µ ⇒ 2 N 2 1 +  µ 2 1  − µ   = √ 2 mg.  (14) Thus, we have N 2  =   mg √ 2 1  − µ 1 +  µ 2  , (15) which can be substituted into equation (12) to find N 1  =   mg √ 2 1 +  µ 1 +  µ 2  . (16) Note that the normal forces  N 1  and  N 2  are different. This is due to the rotation of the cylinder and the kinetic friction force. Looking at the free body diagram above, we see that it is not quite left-right mirror symmetric. Specifically, both of the kinetic friction forces point to the left. This fact means that one cannot assume that  N 1  =  N 2 . Instead one must calculate them, which indeed reveals that they are different. 5 Rigid body rotation and static equilibrium - Solutions to Problem Set 11 Finally, to find the externally applied torque  ⃗ τ a , we must employ equation (2). We will choose the pivot point to be the axis of rotation of the cylinder. Thus, the torque  ⃗ τ  =  ⃗ r  ×   ⃗ F  arising from a force   ⃗ F  depends on the position vector  ⃗ r  from the axis of rotation to the point of application of the force. For the two normal forces, this is  ⃗ τ N 1  =  ⃗ r N 1  ×   ⃗ N 1  =  ⃗ τ N 2  =  ⃗ r N 2  ×   ⃗ N 2  = 0  as the cross product of parallel (or anti-parallel) vectors is zero. Additionally, since the gravitational force is applied at the center of mass of the system, its position vector is  ⃗ r g  = 0 , which means the torque it creates is  ⃗ τ g  = 0  as well. Thus, we have three non-zero torques about the axis of rotation of the cylinder: the externally applied torque  ⃗ τ a  and torques from the two frictional forces  ⃗ τ f 1  and  ⃗ τ f 2 . This means equation (2) can be written as X ⃗ τ ext  =  ⃗ τ a  +  ⃗ τ f 1  +  ⃗ τ f 2  =  ⃗ τ a  +  ⃗ r f 1  ×   ⃗ F f 1  +  ⃗ r f 2  ×   ⃗ F f 2  =  ⃗ τ a  − r f 1 F f 1 ˆ z  − r f 2 F f 2 ˆ z  = 0 , (17) where we have used the definition of a torque  ⃗ τ  =  ⃗ r  ×   ⃗ F , the fact that the frictional forces are perpendicular to the position vectors, and the right-hand rule to evaluate the direction of the cross product. Substituting the form of the frictional force as well as equations (15) and (16) gives ⃗ τ a  =  R  ( µN 1  +  µN 2 ) ˆ z  =  R \\x12 µ mg √ 2 1 +  µ 1 +  µ 2  +  µmg √ 2 1  − µ 1 +  µ 2 \\x13 ˆ z  = √ 2 mgµR 1 +  µ 2  ˆ z, (18) where we also note that the distance to the point of application of the frictional forces is  r f 1  =  r f 2  =  R . Equation (18) is the external torque required to maintain the cylinder at a constant angular velocity. ',\n",

How far from P is the center of mass of the system? 3. What is the angular speed of the pendulum when it is at the bottom of its swing? m 1 L 1 L 2 m 2 θ 0 r 2 P ',\n",
       "  'answer': '1. The total moment of inertia of a system about the axis of rotation P is defined to be I tot P = Z M ρ 2 dm, (1) where  ρ  is the distance from the axis P and the integral is performed over the entire mass of the object. Since an integral is just a sum of infinitesimal elements, we can divide the integral into the sum of integrals over the two parts of the system according to I tot P =  I rod P +  I disk P , (2) where I rod P = Z rod ρ 2 dm (3) and I disk P = Z disk ρ 2 dm. (4) We will first calculate  I disk P . Using the parallel axis theorem, we can relate the moment of inertia of the disk about point P  I disk P to its moment of inertia about its center of mass  I disk CM   according to I disk P =  I disk CM   +  m 2 L 2 2 . (5) The moment of inertia of a disk about its center of mass can be found from a table, which is perfectly acceptable. However, here we will show how to derive it from the definition of the moment of inertia I disk CM   = Z disk ρ 2 dm, (6) 6 Rigid body rotation and static equilibrium - Solutions to Problem Set 11 where  ρ  is the distance from the center of mass of the disk. Since the disk is uniform, we know that its center of mass is at its geometric center and it has an areal density of σ  =   m 2 πr 2 2 =  ∆ m ∆ A  , (7) where  ∆ A  is a differential element of area. We can use  σ  to rewrite the integral over mass in equation (6) as an integral over area according to I disk CM   = Z disk ρ 2 σdA. (8) While the differential area is  dA  =  dxdy  in Cartesian coordinates, we would like to use polar coordinates to reflect the geometry of the disk. In polar coordinates  dA  =  ρdϕdρ , which you can see by calculating the area of a differential element with a small extent in radius  ρ  and angle  ϕ . Thus, we can write I disk CM   = Z  r 2 0 Z  2 π 0 ρ 2 σρdϕdρ, (9) where we’ve chosen the bounds such that the integrals span the entire disk. Since the argument of the integral has no  ϕ  dependence, we find I disk CM   = 2 πσ Z  r 2 0 r 3 dr. (10) The integral over radius is also straightforward, giving I disk CM   = 2 πσ \\x12 r 4 2 4   − 0 \\x13 =   m 2 2   r 2 2 , (11) where we have substituted in equation (7). Combining this with equation (5) gives the final expression for the moment of inertia of the disk about P I disk P =   m 2 2   r 2 2   +  m 2 L 2 2 . (12) To calculate the moment of inertia of the rod, we can use the result from a table, which again is perfectly acceptable. However, here we will again show how to derive it from the definition of the moment of inertia I rod P = Z rod ρ 2 dm, (13) where  ρ  is the distance from the axis P passing through the end of the rod. Since the rod is uniform, we know that it has an linear density of λ  =   m 1 L 1 =  ∆ m ∆ ρ  , (14) where  ∆ ρ  is a linear differential element along the length of the rod. We can use  λ  to rewrite the integral over mass in equation (13) as an integral over length according to I rod P = Z rod ρ 2 λdρ. (15) Thus, the integral over the entire rod is just I rod P =  λ Z  L 1 0 ρ 2 dρ  =  λ \\x12 L 3 1 3   − 0 \\x13 =   m 1 3   L 2 1 . (16) Substituting this and equation (12) into equation (2) gives the final answer of I tot P =   m 1 3   L 2 1   +  m 2 2   r 2 2   +  m 2 L 2 2 . (17) 7 Rigid body rotation and static equilibrium - Solutions to Problem Set 11 2. The center of mass of any system is given by ⃗ R CM  = P i   m i ⃗ r i P i   m i . (18) Here our system has two objects: the rod and the disk. Given that the rod is uniform, we know that its center of mass is at its midpoint, which is a distance  L 1 / 2  from the point P. Similarly, since the disk is uniform, its center of mass is at its geometric center, which is a distance  L 2  from the axis P. The calculation is one dimensional as both of these distances are in the same direction (i.e. along the length of the rod). Plugging this information into equation (18) gives a distance of R CM  =   m 1 ( L 1 / 2) +  m 2 ( L 2 ) m 1  +  m 2 =   m 1 L 1 / 2 +  m 2 L 2 m 1  +  m 2 . (19) 3. As all of the forces acting on the pendulum system are conservative, we can impose conservation of mechanical energy E mi  =  E mf (20) between the initial state described in the problem (denoted by the subscript  i ) and the final state when the pendulum is at the bottom of its swing (denoted by the subscript  f ). The only forces involved are gravity, so equation (20) is K i  +  U gi  =  K f  +  U gf . (21) The system is released from rest, so  K i  = 0 . Additionally, we will define the reference point for the gravitational potential energy to be the location of the center of mass when the pendulum is at the bottom of its swing, so  U gf  = 0 . Thus, we can use the forms of the rotational kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy to write equation (21) as 0 + ( m 1  +  m 2 )  g ∆ h  =   I tot P 2   ω 2 f   + 0 , (22) where  ∆ h  is the change in height of the center of mass from its final position to its initial position and  ω f  is the angular speed that we are trying to find. From the picture below, we see that  ∆ h  = R CM  − R CM  cos  θ 0 .

       "  'answer': 'The are three forces acting on the beam. The gravitational force (which acts at the beam’s center of mass), the tension force from the rope (which acts at the point of connection between the rope and the beam), and the normal force from the wall (which acts at the point of contact between the wall and the beam).

For the normal force from the wall this is  ⃗ r N  = 0  as the force is applied at the origin. For the gravitational force this is  ⃗ r g  = ( L/ 2)ˆ x  as it acts at the center of mass, which 9 Rigid body rotation and static equilibrium - Solutions to Problem Set 11 is in the middle (given that the beam is uniform).

This force is given by ⃗ F G  =  − Gm p m i r 2 ˆ r, (1) where  r  is the distance between the instrument and the center of the planet,  ˆ r  is the radial unit vector pointing from the center of the planet towards the instrument, and  G  is the universal gravitational constant.

Thus, since the total external torque on the instrument about the center of the planet is zero, its angular momentum about the center of the planet must be conserved throughout its motion. Conservation of angular momentum is expressed as ⃗ L i  =   ⃗ L f , (3) where the angular momentum is ⃗ L  =  ⃗ r  ×  ⃗ p  =  ⃗ r  ×  m i ⃗ v. (4) Here  ⃗ p  and  ⃗ v  are the momentum and velocity of the instrument respectively. It is natural to define a cylindrical coordinate system with its origin at the center of the planet. The initial velocity can be found from trigonometry and the figure below to be ⃗ v i  =  − v 0  cos  θ ˆ r  +  v 0  sin  θ   ˆ ϕ.

At this instant, the position vector is  ⃗ r f  =  r p ˆ r  and the final velocity  ⃗ v f  =  v f   ˆ ϕ  is in the direction exactly tangent to the surface.

(8) However, this equation still has two unknowns  v f  and  θ , so we require another condition. To determine the final velocity of the instrument, we can think about the situation physically. We realize that the instrument will be accelerated as it falls into the gravitational potential of the planet. The change in speed of the instrument can be found from conservation of mechanical energy because there are no nonconservative forces acting on the instrument. Thus, we have E mi  =  E mf ⇒ K i  +  U Gi  =  K f  +  U Gf .

What is the locomotive’s final speed  v f  relative to the ground ? 1 Angular momentum - Problem Set 12 ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'We begin by choosing our system to consist of the locomotive and the track. Because there are no  external torques about the central vertical axis, the angular momentum of our system must remain constant about that axis ⃗ L i sys   =  ⃗ L f sys . (1) The initial angular momentum of the system is ⃗ L i sys   = 0 (2) because both the locomotive and the track are at rest. The final angular momentum will be composed of the angular momentum of the locomotive and the track according to ⃗ L f sys   =  ⃗ L f L   +  ⃗ L f T   , (3) where the subscripts  L  and  T  refer to the locomotive and track respectively. The final angular momentum of the locomotive (which can be considered to be a point mass) is given by ⃗ L f L   =  ⃗ R L  ×  ⃗ p L  =  R T  ˆ r  ×  m L ⃗ v L , (4) where  ⃗ r L  is the position vector from the pivot point at the top of the vertical axis to the locomotive,  ⃗ p L  is momentum of the locomotive in the ground reference frame, and  ⃗ v L  is the velocity of the locomotive relative to the ground. From the figure we see that the locomotive is moving only in the   ˆ ϕ  direction, so  ⃗ v L  =  v f   ˆ ϕ 2 Angular momentum - Solutions to Problem Set 12 (where  v f  is the final speed relative to the floor that we are trying to determine). Plugging this into equation (4) produces ⃗ L f L   =  R T  ˆ r  ×  m L v f   ˆ ϕ  =  R T  m L v f  ˆ z, (5) where the   ˆ ϕ  unit vector points counter-clockwise (when viewed from above) and the  ˆ z  unit vector points upwards. Next we must determine the final angular momentum of the track (which is a continuous system). We know that the moment of inertia of a thin uniform ring about an axis passing through its center is I T  =  m T  R 2 T   .

       "  'answer': '1. The motion of any rigid body can be represented as the motion of the center of mass, plus a rotation about the center of mass. In problem set 6, we found the position of the center of mass after the collision to be ⃗ R CM ( t ) =   V 0 2   t ˆ x  +   ℓ 4  ˆ y. (1) However, to completely specify the motion of the particle-rod system, we must also calculate the angular velocity of rotation of the system  about its center of mass . To calculate the rotation after the collision from the information just before the collision, we will use conservation of angular momentum about the center of mass (as there are no external torques acting on the particle-rod system). This is expressed as ⃗ L b  =   ⃗ L a . (2) where the subscript “b” indicates that the quantity is evaluated just before the collision and the subscript “a” indicates just after. Just before the collision, the angular momentum of the system about the center of mass is the sum of the angular momenta of all the objects  i  in the system. This is ⃗ L b  = X i ⃗ L ib  = X i ⃗ r ib  ×  m i ⃗ v ib  =  ⃗ r pb  ×  M⃗ v pb , (3) where the subscript “p” indicates the particle. Note that there is no contribution to the angular momentum from the rod as it is completely stationary before the collision. From inspecting the problem statement we see that, just before the collision, the particle is moving with  ⃗ v pb  =  V 0 ˆ x  at a position  ⃗ r pb  =  − ( ℓ/ 4)ˆ y  relative to the center of mass of the particle-rod system at  t  = 0 . Substituting these values, equation (3) becomes ⃗ L b  =   M 4   ℓV 0 ˆ z. (4) After the collision, the rod and particle form a combined object that rotates at a common angular velocity  ⃗ ω  about its center of mass. The angular momentum of such an rotating extended object is ⃗ L a  =  I CM ⃗ ω, (5) where  I CM  is the momentum of inertia of the particle-rod system about its center of mass. Substituting this and equation (4) into equation (2) allows us to find ⃗ ω  = M 4 I CM ℓV 0 ˆ z. (6) This is almost the final solution, but we don’t yet know  I CM . To calculate it, we start from the definition of the center of mass I CM  = Z M ρ 2 dm, (7) where the integral is taken over the entire mass of the combined object. Because integrals are just summations of infinitesimally small differential elements, we can separate it into the contributions from the two objects I CM  = Z rod ρ 2 dm  + Z particle ρ 2 dm  =  I rod  +  I particle . (8) 4 Angular momentum - Solutions to Problem Set 12 Since the particle is well represented by a point mass, all of its mass is located at the same distance ρ  =  ℓ/ 4  from the center of mass. Thus, I particle  = Z particle ρ 2 dm  = Z particle \\x12  ℓ 4 \\x13 2 dm  =   ℓ 2 16 Z particle dm  =  1 16 Mℓ 2 . (9) There are two ways to find the contribution to the moment of inertia from the rod. This first is simpler and uses the parallel axis theorem. From the table of moments of inertia presented in lecture, we know that a uniform thin rod rotated about its center of mass (i.e. its geometric center) has a moment of inertia of  I center rod =  Mℓ 2 / 12 . However, we are interested in the rotation of the rod about the center of mass of the particle-rod system, not the center of mass of the rod alone. From equation (1), we see that the center of mass of the rod (which is at  ( ℓ/ 2)ˆ y ) is a distance of  h  =  ℓ/ 4  away from the center of mass of the particle-rod system at  t  = 0 . Thus, we will use the parallel axis theorem to see that I rod  =  I center rod +  Mh 2   =  1 12 Mℓ 2  + 1 16 Mℓ 2  = 7 48 Mℓ 2 . (10) The second way to find the moment of inertia of the rod is to directly evaluate the integral in equation (8). This approach is more challenging, but applies to a wider variety of situations. To convert from an integral over mass to an integral in space, we use the linear mass density  λ  =  dm/dρ  and the fact that the density is uniform  λ  =  M/ℓ to see that  dm  = ( M/ℓ ) dρ . Substituting this we see that I rod  = Z rod ρ 2 dm  =   M ℓ Z rod ρ 2 dρ. (11) To determine the bounds of the integral, we must think about the geometry of the problem. Here  ρ represents the distance from the center of mass of the particle-rod system, which is at  y  =  ℓ/ 4 . Thus, to integrate over the full object we must consider the part of the rod above and below the center of mass, which is tricky as some of these points have the same value of  ρ . This can be handled by splitting the integral into the contributions above and below, which are given by I rod  =   M ℓ Z  3 ℓ/ 4 0 ρ 2 dρ  +   M ℓ Z  ℓ/ 4 0 ρ 2 dρ. (12) respectively.

Substituting equation (9) and (13) into equation (8) gives the total moment of inertia of the particle-rod system around its center of mass, which is I CM  =  7 48 Mℓ 2  + 1 16 Mℓ 2  = 5 24 Mℓ 2 . (14) Substituting this into equation (6) gives the final answer of ⃗ ω  =  6 5 V 0 ℓ ˆ z. (15) Importantly, since there are no additional forces acting at later times, we have conservation of angular momentum. Thus, the angular velocity of the particle-rod system remains the same at all times  t  ≥ 0 . 5 Angular momentum - Solutions to Problem Set 12 2. We know that the particle-rod system moves based on the combination of two types of motion. Its center of mass translates, which has been calculated in equation (1). Additionally, in the center of mass reference frame, all points in the system rotate about the center of mass with a constant angular velocity  ⃗ ω  = (6 / 5)( V 0 /ℓ )ˆ z . This rotation is uniform circular motion, so the angular velocity corresponds to a velocity of ⃗ v  =  ⃗ ω  ×  ⃗ ρ  =  ω ˆ z  ×  ρ ˆ ρ  =  ρω   ˆ ϕ. (16) We are asked about the position of the particle, which is located at a distance  ρ  =  ℓ/ 4  away from the center of mass. Thus, it has a velocity of ⃗ v  =   ℓ 4 ω  ˆ ϕ (17) after the collision. Note that if we substitute the value for  ω , we find  ⃗ v  = (6 / 20) V 0   ˆ ϕ , which shows that the particle is slowed down substantially as a result of the collision. Ultimately, we want to express the position in Cartesian coordinates, so we will convert the cylindrical unit vector   ˆ ϕ  according to ⃗ v  =   ℓ 4 ω  ( − sin  ϕ ˆ x  + cos  ϕ ˆ y )  . (18) Given that  ω  is constant, we can integrate the definition of the angular speed   ˙ ϕ  =  ω  to find ϕ ( t ) =  ωt  +  C, (19) where  C  is an integration constant. Since  ϕ  is the angle from the  + x -axis and increases towards the + y -axis, at  t  = 0  the particle is at  ϕ (0) =  − π/ 2 . Using this initial condition, we find that  C  =  − π/ 2 . Substituting this and equation (19) into equation (18) gives ⃗ v ( t ) =   ℓ 4 ω \\x10 − sin \\x10 ωt  − π 2 \\x11 ˆ x  + cos \\x10 ωt  − π 2 \\x11 ˆ y \\x11 =   ℓ 4 ω  (cos ( ωt ) ˆ x  + sin ( ωt ) ˆ y )  , (20) where in the second step we have used trigonometric identities that one can find in a table. This result is consistent with our intuition – the bottom of the rod should start rotating to the right, in the same direction the particle strikes it. To find the position, we simply integrate equation (20) to find ⃗ r ( t ) =   ℓ 4  (sin ( ωt ) ˆ x  − cos ( ωt ) ˆ y )  . (21) However, we must remember that the position  ⃗ r ( t )  is in the reference frame moving with the center of mass of the particle-rod system. Thus, we must change back to the reference frame given in the problem statement using   ⃗ R p ( t ) =   ⃗ R CM ( t ) +  ⃗ r ( t ) . This yields the final answer of ⃗ R p ( t ) =   ⃗ R CM ( t ) +   ℓ 4  (sin( ωt )ˆ x  − cos( ωt )ˆ y )  . (22) ',\n",

       "  'answer': '1. (4 points) In the vertical direction, the ring experiences only gravity and the normal force and does not accelerate. Thus, the vertical component of Newton’s second law for the ring tells us that N  − mg  = 0 ⇒ N  =  mg. (1) 6 Angular momentum - Solutions to Problem Set 12 In the horizontal direction, kinetic friction causes a force ⃗ F f  =  − µN  ˆ x  =  − µmg ˆ x, (2) where we have defined the direction of motion of the ring to be the  ˆ x  direction. Since this is the only horizontal force on the ring, Newton’s second law in the  ˆ x  direction tells us that the corresponding acceleration is constant and has a value of F fx  =  ma ⇒ − µmg  =  ma ⇒ a  =  − µg. (3) According to the work-kinetic energy theorem, the change in kinetic energy is equal to the work done by friction. Since the disk starts out with kinetic energy  K i  =  E 0  and finishes at rest with  K f  = 0 , we know that ∆ K  =  W ⇒ K f  − K i  = Z ⃗ F f  ·  d ⃗ l ⇒ 0  − E 0  = Z  ∆ x 0 − µmg ˆ x  ·  (ˆ xdx ) ⇒ E 0  =  µmg ∆ x,  (4) where  ∆ x  is the total distance traveled by the ring and we have used equation (2). The ring undergoes motion under constant acceleration, so we can immediately write down its velocity as v ( t ) =  at  +  v 0  =  − µgt  +  v 0 , (5) where we have used equation (3). We can use this to find the time at which the ring will stop, which gives v ( t 1 ) = 0 =  − µgt 1  +  v 0 ⇒ t 1  =   v 0 µg  . (6) To calculate the initial velocity, we can use the formula for the translational kinetic energy and find K  =   m 2   v 2 ⇒ K i  =  E 0  =   m 2   v 2 0 ⇒ v 0  = r 2 E 0 m  . (7) Substituting this into equation (6) gives the final answer of t 1  =  1 µg r 2 E 0 m  . (8) Alternative solution: Kinetic friction causes a horizontal force, which will reduce the momentum of the ring. Let the initial velocity of the ring be  ⃗ v 0  =  v 0 ˆ x , directed along the horizontal axis  x . The initial momentum and kinetic energy of the ring are ⃗ p 0  =  mv 0 ˆ x (9) K i  =  E 0  =   m 2   v 2 0 (10) respectively. Solving equation (10) for  v 0  and plugging it into equation (9) gives ⃗ p 0  =  m r 2 E 0 m   ˆ x  = p 2 mE 0 ˆ x. (11) The only net horizontal force on the ring arises from kinetic friction, which is given by equation (2). This force   ⃗ F f  is constant. Thus, the generalized version of Newton’s second law,  d⃗ p/dt  =   ⃗ F , can be integrated to show that ⃗ p ( t ) =   ⃗ F f t  +  ⃗ p 0  = \\x10 − µmgt  + p 2 mE 0 \\x11 ˆ x (12) 7 Angular momentum - Solutions to Problem Set 12 using equations (2) and (11). From this we can find the time at which the ring comes to rest to be ⃗ p ( t 1 ) = 0 = \\x10 − µmgt 1  + p 2 mE 0 \\x11 ˆ x ⇒ t 1  = 1 µmg p 2 mE 0 ⇒ t 1  =  1 µg r 2 E 0 m  , (13) which is consistent with equation (8) . 2. (5 points) For the rest of this problem, we use a cylindrical coordinate system  ( ρ, ϕ, z )  with its origin  O at the center of the ring and the vertical  ˆ z  direction pointing  downwards . Friction results in a vertical torque, which will reduce the angular momentum of the ring with time. We will first calculate the initial angular momentum and then find the strength of the torque to determine how quickly it will come to rest. Let  ⃗ ω 0  =  ω 0 ˆ z  be the initial angular velocity with  ˆ z  defined to be downwards such that  ω 0  >  0 . The initial angular momentum about pivot point  O  is then ⃗ L 0  =  I⃗ ω 0  =  Iω 0 ˆ z, (14) where  I  is the moment of inertia about the  ˆ z  axis. The initial kinetic energy of the ring is its rotational kinetic energy, which can be used to find the initial angular velocity to be K i  =  E 0  =   I 2 ω 2 0 ⇒ ω 0  =  ± r 2 E 0 I ⇒ ω 0  = r 2 E 0 I  . (15) Here we have used the fact that  ω 0  >  0  to choose the positive sign in front of the square root. We can plug equation (15) into equation (14) to obtain ⃗ L 0  =  I r 2 E 0 I ˆ z  = p 2 IE 0 ˆ z. (16) Given that the moment of inertia of a thin horizontal ring around the  z -axis, this becomes ⃗ L 0  = q 2 ( mρ 2 0 )  E 0 ˆ z  =  ρ 0 p 2 mE 0 ˆ z. (17) To calculate the torque exerted by the kinetic friction force, we need to integrate around the circum- ference of the ring. A given infinitesimal element of the ring has a mass  ∆ m i , where the subscript denotes which differential element is being considered. Drawing a free body diagram for the differential element  i  shows that the only forces in the vertical direction are gravity  ∆ m i g  and the normal force ∆ N i . Since no part of the ring experiences a vertical acceleration, the vertical component of Newton’s second law gives ∆ N i  − ∆ m i g  = 0 ⇒ ∆ N i  = ∆ m i g. (18) In the tangential   ˆ ϕ  direction, the differential element will experience a kinetic frictional force given by ∆ ⃗ F fi  =  − µ ∆ N i   ˆ ϕ  =  − µ ∆ m i g   ˆ ϕ, (19) which points in the opposite direction to the rotation as to slow the object down. Note that   ˆ ϕ  must point clockwise when viewed from above for the  ( ρ, ϕ, z )  coordinate system to be right-handed. Since the differential element has a position vector of  ⃗ r i  =  ρ i ˆ ρ  =  ρ 0 ˆ ρ , we can calculate the torque from this force to be ∆ ⃗ τ i  =  ⃗ r i  ×  ∆ ⃗ F fi  = ( ρ 0 ˆ ρ )  × \\x10 − µ ∆ m i g   ˆ ϕ \\x11 =  − ρ 0 µ ∆ m i g ˆ ρ  ×   ˆ ϕ  =  − ρ 0 µ ∆ m i g ˆ z. (20) To find the overall torque on the ring  ⃗ τ , we add up the contributions from every differential element, which, in the limit of  ∆ m i  → 0 , becomes the integral ⃗ τ  = lim ∆ m i → 0 X i ∆ ⃗ τ i  = lim ∆ m i → 0 X i ( − ρ 0 µ ∆ m i g ˆ z ) = Z ring ( − ρ 0 µg ˆ z )  dm  =  − ρ 0 µg \\x12Z ring dm \\x13 ˆ z. (21) 8 Angular momentum - Solutions to Problem Set 12 Given that the integral of  1  over the entire mass of the object is just the total mass  m , we find ⃗ τ  =  − ρ 0 µg  ( m ) ˆ z. (22) We see that this torque is in the direction opposite to the ring’s angular velocity as is intuitive. Since this torque is constant, integrating the formula  d ⃗ L/dt  =  ⃗ τ  in time shows that ⃗ L ( t ) =  ⃗ τt  +   ⃗ L 0 . (23) Plugging in equations (17) and (22) gives ⃗ L ( t ) =  − ρ 0 µgmt ˆ z  +  ρ 0 p 2 mE 0 ˆ z  =  ρ 0 \\x10p 2 mE 0  − µgmt \\x11 ˆ z.

(25) Dividing this by equation (8) shows that the ratio  t 2 /t 1  = 1 . Alternative solution: Since friction does not depend on the surface area, we can consider the torque due to the friction of the ring as equivalent to the torque from a single point mass at the same radius ⃗ τ f  =  ⃗ r  ×   ⃗ F f  = ( ρ 0 ˆ ρ )  × \\x10 − µN   ˆ ϕ \\x11 =  − µNρ 0 ˆ ρ  ×   ˆ ϕ  =  − µmg ˆ z, (26) where we have used  N  =  mg  from Newton’s law in the vertical direction. We can then apply Newton’s second law for rotational motion in the  ˆ z  direction and substitute equation (26) to find Σ ⃗ τ  =  I⃗ α ⇒ ⃗ τ f  =  mρ 2 0 ⃗ α ⇒ − µmgρ 0  =  mρ 2 0 α ⇒ α  =  − µg ρ 0 , (27) where  I  =  mρ 2 0   is the moment of inertia of the ring around the  z  axis and the only net torque is from the friction force. Thus, the angular acceleration is constant in time. Integrating equation (27) in time gives ω ( t ) =  − µg ρ 0 t  +  ω 0 , (28) where  ω 0  is the initial angular velocity at  t  = 0 . Substituting equation (15) and  I  =  mρ 2 0 , this can be used to find the time  t 2  at which the angular velocity becomes zero to be ω ( t 2 ) = 0 =  − µg ρ 0 t 2  + r 2 E 0 I =  − µg ρ 0 t 2  + s 2 E 0 mρ 2 0 ⇒ t 2  =  1 µg r 2 E 0 m  . (29) This is consistent with equation (25). 3. (1 points) The calculation of the time  t 1  stays the same because, for pure translation, the object is considered to be a point mass, so it doesn’t matter if the object is a ring or a disk. To find  t 2 , we should first calculate the total torque arising from the frictional force. As in part 2, we can do this by integrating the force acting on all the differential elements that make up the object. The frictional force on a differential mass element is still given by equation (19). However, the torque must take into account that different mass elements can now be located at different radii  ⃗ r i  =  ρ i ˆ ρ . Thus, the torque expressed by equation (20) becomes modified to be ∆ ⃗ τ i  =  ⃗ r i  ×  ∆ ⃗ F fi  = ( ρ i ˆ ρ )  × \\x10 − µ ∆ m i g   ˆ ϕ \\x11 =  − ρ i µ ∆ m i g ˆ ρ  ×   ˆ ϕ  =  − ρ i µ ∆ m i g ˆ z, (30) 9 Angular momentum - Solutions to Problem Set 12 where we must remember that we’ve defined   ˆ ϕ  to point clockwise and  ˆ z  to point down. To find the overall torque on the ring  ⃗ τ , we add up the contributions from every differential element, which, in the limit of  ∆ m i  → 0 , becomes the integral ⃗ τ  = lim ∆ m i → 0 X i ∆ ⃗ τ i  = lim ∆ m i → 0 X i ( − ρ i µ ∆ m i g ˆ z ) = Z disk ( − ρ i µg ˆ z )  dm. (31) Given that the disk is uniform, we can use the areal density to show σ  =   m πρ 2 0 =   dm dA ⇒ dm  =   m πρ 2 0 dA, (32) where  dA  is the differential element of area. In polar coordinates, it is expressed as  dA  =  ρ i dϕdρ i . Substituting this and equation (32) into equation (31) gives ⃗ τ  = Z ring ( − ρ i µg ˆ z )   m πρ 2 0 ρ i dϕdρ i  =  − µg  m πρ 2 0 Z  ρ 0 0 Z  2 π 0 ρ 2 i   dϕdρ i ˆ z.

(34) Evaluating the integral in radius gives ⃗ τ  =  − 2 µg  m ρ 2 0 \\x12 ρ 3 0 3   − 0 3 3 \\x13 ˆ z  =  − 2 3 µgmρ 0 ˆ z. (35) We see that this torque is in the direction opposite to the ring’s angular velocity as is intuitive. Since this torque is constant, integrating the formula  d ⃗ L/dt  =  ⃗ τ  (i.e. the generalized version of Newton’s second law for rotation) in time shows that ⃗ L ( t ) =   ⃗ L 0  +  ⃗ τt. (36) To calculate  L 0  we can use equation (16) from part 2, but we must use the moment of inertia of a disk I  =  mρ 2 0 / 2  (rather than a ring) to find ⃗ L 0  = r 2 mρ 2 0 2   E 0 ˆ z  =  ρ 0 p mE 0 ˆ z.

Since the satellite is not burning any fuel, the gravitational attraction to the planet must be causing the centripetal acceleration enabling the uniform circular motion. This condition is expressed through Newton’s second law for the satellite as ⃗ F G  =  m s ⃗ a cent .

Now let’s compare  v 0  with  v c , given that  r 0  =  r c . Even though we have a solution for both, given by equations (7) and (10), this turns out to be surprisingly tricky.

Substituting this,  K 0  = 0 , and the form of the rotational kinetic energy  K  = ( I/ 2) ω 2 into equation (8) gives 0  − mgL  cos  ϕ 0  =   I 2 ω 2  − mgL  cos  ϕ, (10) where  ω  is the angular speed. For a point mass located a distance  ρ  =  L  away from the axis of rotation, the moment of inertia is  I  =  mL 2 . Employing this and taking the time derivative of equation (10) using the chain rule yields 0 =   mL 2 2 \\x12 2 ω  dω dt \\x13 +  mgL  sin  ϕ dϕ dt ⇒ 0 =  Lω  dω dt   +  g  sin  ϕdϕ dt  . (11) Identifying that  ω  =  dϕ/dt  produces 0 =  Lω  d 2 ϕ dt 2  +  gω  sin  ϕ ⇒ d 2 ϕ dt 2  +  g L   sin  ϕ  = 0 , (12) which is identical to equation (5). Thus, energy conservation gives the same answer as Newton’s second law. 2. The differential equation for a simple harmonic oscillator has the form d 2 ϕ dt 2  +  ω 2 0 ϕ  = 0 , (13) where  ω 0  is the angular frequency of oscillation. Thus, by comparison with equation (6), we see that ω 0  = r  g L . (14) 2 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - Solutions to Problem Set 13 To get the frequency  f 0  (i.e. the number of oscillations per second) from the angular frequency (i.e. the average number of radians the object completes in its oscillation per second), we use the fact that one oscillation corresponds to  2 π  radians. This means that  ω 0  = 2 πf 0 , so f 0  =  1 2 π r  g L . (15) 3. The period is the time it takes for the object to complete a full oscillation (i.e. the number of seconds per oscillation). This is simply the inverse of the number of oscillations per second (i.e. the frequency). Thus, using  T 0  = 1 /f 0  we find the period to be T 0  = 2 π s L g  . (16) 4. The angular velocity of the point mass at a given location is easiest to calculate from conservation of energy. We can take equation (10) and let  ϕ  = 0  to choose the final state to be when the pendulum is at the bottom of its swing − mgL  cos  ϕ 0  =   I 2 ω 2  − mgL. (17) Given that  I  =  mL 2 , we can rewrite this as − mgL  cos  ϕ 0  =   mL 2 2 ω 2   − mgL ⇒ ω  = r 2   g L   (1  − cos  ϕ 0 ) . (18) The translational speed  v  =  v ϕ  is purely tangential, which is related to the angular speed  ω  through v ϕ  =  ρω. (19) Substituting equation (18) and the fact that  ρ  =  L  gives v ϕ  =  L r 2   g L   (1  − cos  ϕ 0 ) ⇒ v ϕ  = p 2 gL  (1  − cos  ϕ 0 ) . (20) 5. No, these are not the same. The angular speed  ω  =  dϕ/dt  is the rate of change in the angular position of the pendulum (where  2 π  radians corresponds to a  full circle  in our polar coordinate  ϕ ). The angular frequency  ω 0  = p g/L  represents the average number of radians the object completes per second (where 2 π  radians corresponds to a  full oscillation ). Moreover, the angular speed  ω  will change throughout the pendulum’s motion, while the angular frequency  ω 0  is defined such that it is always a constant. 6. No, as shown by equation (16). Since the mass appears on both sides in Newton’s second law (see equation (3)), it cancels out. ',\n",

These connect to a massless bar of total length  L , which is centered such that it extends a distance  ℓ =  L/ 2  on each side of the hoop. The hoop and spokes are free to rotate about the bar. A demonstrator holds each end of the bar in a horizontal position, while the hoop is rotating at an angular velocity  ω h ˆ x . Find the magnitude and direction of the additional force exerted by each of the demonstrator’s hands in order to cause the following motion.

The bar is accelerated with a constant acceleration  a ˆ x  in the direction along the length of the bar. 2. The bar is rotated at a constant angular velocity  ω b ˆ z  in a horizontal plane around its center. 1 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - Problem Set 13 ',\n",
       "  'answer': '1. Since we are interesting in finding the  additional  force required to achieve particular motion, we can ignore the force of gravity. The only forces we must consider are the additional force from the demon- strator’s hand on the  right  end of the bar   ⃗ F r  and the additional force from the demonstrator’s hand on the  left  end of the bar   ⃗ F l . Note that here the subscript  r  indicate the right end of the bar, while the subscript  l  indicates the left. If the gyroscope is displaced in a direction parallel to its axis of rotation, there is no change in angular momentum. Since  d ⃗ L/dt  = 0 , the net torque can be found to be ⃗ τ net  =   d⃗ L dt   = 0 (1) 3 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - Solutions to Problem Set 13 from Newton’s second law for rotation, where we recall that a torque is defined to be  ⃗ τ  =  ⃗ r  ×   ⃗ F . Thus, since   ⃗ F r  is applied at  ⃗ r r  =  ℓ ˆ x  and   ⃗ F l  is applied at  ⃗ r l  =  − ℓ ˆ x , they must satisfy ⃗ τ net  =  ⃗ τ r  +  ⃗ τ l  =  ⃗ r r  ×   ⃗ F r  +  ⃗ r l  ×   ⃗ F l  =  ℓ ˆ x  ×   ⃗ F r  − ℓ ˆ x  ×   ⃗ F l  = 0 ⇒ ˆ x  × \\x10 ⃗ F r  − ⃗ F l \\x11 = 0 . (2) Note that we have defined the origin to be the initial position of the center of the wheel. a x y z To accelerate a mass  M , we need a net force   ⃗ F net  given by Newton’s second law of ⃗ F net  =  M⃗ a  =  Ma ˆ x. (3) Thus, the additional forces from the demonstrator’s hands must also satisfy ⃗ F r  +   ⃗ F l  =  Ma ˆ x ⇒ ⃗ F l  =  Ma ˆ x  − ⃗ F r . (4) Substituting equation (4) into equation (2) gives ˆ x  × \\x10 ⃗ F r  − \\x10 Ma ˆ x  − ⃗ F r \\x11\\x11 = 0 ⇒ ˆ x  ×   ⃗ F r  = 0 . (5) as  ˆ x ×  ˆ x  = 0 . Writing out   ⃗ F r  =  F rx ˆ x + F ry ˆ y  + F rz ˆ z  component-by-component in Cartesian coordinates allows us to reformulate the equation as ˆ x  ×  ( F rx ˆ x  +  F ry ˆ y  +  F rz ˆ z ) = 0 ⇒ F ry ˆ z  − F rz ˆ y  = 0 . (6) If we take the dot product of this equation with  ˆ z , we see that  F ry  = 0  and if we take the dot product of this equation with  ˆ y , we see that  F rz  = 0 . This implies that ⃗ F r  =  F rx ˆ x  =  F r ˆ x (7) must be purely in the  ˆ x  direction. Through substitution into equation (4), we see that the same is true for ⃗ F l  =  Ma ˆ x  − F r ˆ x  = ( Ma  − F r ) ˆ x  =  F l ˆ x. (8) Taking the dot product of both sides of this equation with  ˆ x , we find Ma  − F r  =  F l ⇒ F r  +  F l  =  Ma. (9) Thus, the additional forces from each hand must only have an  ˆ x  component and satisfy  F r  +  F l  =  Ma . 4 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - Solutions to Problem Set 13 2. This problem is tricky because there are two different types of rotation. There is the rotation of the hoop about the axis, which has a constant magnitude  ω h  that starts out in the  ˆ x  direction at  t  = 0 . However, it changes direction because the bar is made to rotate about its center with a constant angular velocity  ω b ˆ z . The second type of rotation (i.e. the rotation of the bar in the  x - y  plane) causes the angular momentum to change. To quantify this second type of rotation, we will use the cylindrical coordinate system shown in the figure below (which shows the wheel from a top view relative to the figure in the problem statement). ω h ϕ ω h x z y ρ z ϕ We can write the total angular momentum of the system (including both types of rotation) as ⃗ L sys  =   ⃗ L h  +   ⃗ L b  =  I h ω h ˆ ρ  +  I b ω b ˆ z, (10) where  ˆ ρ  is changing with time and the subscripts  h  and  b  indicate the hoop and bar respectively. The hoop is thin and rotating about its center, so its moment of inertia is  I h  =  MR 2 . The bar is massless, but its rotation also rotates the hoop about its diameter. Thus, it has a moment of inertia of  I b  =  MR 2 / 2 , which we have found from a table noting that the hoop is thin (meaning it has zero width). Substituting these values into equation (10), we find ⃗ L sys  =  MR 2 ω h ˆ ρ  +   M 2   R 2 ω b ˆ z. (11) A change in angular momentum is always caused by a net torque, which can be found from Newton’s second law for rotation ⃗ τ net  =   d⃗ L sys dt . (12) Substituting equation (11) gives ⃗ τ net  =   d dt \\x12 MR 2 ω h ˆ ρ  +   M 2   R 2 ω b ˆ z \\x13 =  MR 2 ω h d ˆ ρ dt  . (13) In lecture 4a, we calculated the derivatives of the cylindrical unit vectors, finding that  d ˆ ρ/dt  = ( dϕ/dt ) ˆ ϕ . Since the bar is changing angular position  ϕ  at a constant angular speed  ω b  =  dϕ/dt , we can write d ˆ ρ/dt  =  ω b   ˆ ϕ . Substituting this into equation (13) produces ⃗ τ net  =  MR 2 ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ. (14) This torque must arise from the forces applied at the end of the bar by the demonstrator’s hands. Thus, analogously to equation 2, we have ⃗ τ net  =  ⃗ τ r  +  ⃗ τ l  =  ⃗ r r  ×   ⃗ F r  +  ⃗ r l  ×   ⃗ F l  =  ℓ ˆ ρ  ×   ⃗ F r  − ℓ ˆ ρ  ×   ⃗ F l  =  MR 2 ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ (15) ⇒ ˆ ρ  × \\x10 ⃗ F r  − ⃗ F l \\x11 =   MR 2 ℓ ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ, (16) 5 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - Solutions to Problem Set 13 where we must take into account the rotation of the bar into our expression for the radial position of the demonstrator’s hands by using  ˆ ρ  instead of  ˆ x . Additionally, we know that the center of the bar (i.e. the center of mass of the system) has no translational motion. Thus, by Newton’s first law, the net force must be equal to ⃗ F net  =   ⃗ F r  +   ⃗ F l  = 0 ⇒ ⃗ F l  =  − ⃗ F r . (17) Substituting this into equation (16) gives ˆ ρ  × \\x10 ⃗ F r  +   ⃗ F r \\x11 =   MR 2 ℓ ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ ⇒ ˆ ρ  ×   ⃗ F r  =   MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ. (18) Writing out   ⃗ F r  =  F rρ ˆ ρ  +  F rϕ   ˆ ϕ  +  F rz ˆ z  component-by-component in cylindrical coordinates shows that ˆ ρ  × \\x10 F rρ ˆ ρ  +  F rϕ   ˆ ϕ  +  F rz ˆ z \\x11 =   MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ ⇒ F rϕ ˆ z  − F rz   ˆ ϕ  =   MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b   ˆ ϕ. (19) Looking at each component of this equation, we see that we must have  F rϕ  = 0  and − F rz  =   MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b ⇒ F rz  =  − MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b . (20) Plugging this into equation (17) shows that  F lϕ  = 0  and F lz  =   MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b . (21) Thus, our final answer is ⃗ F r  =  F ρr  ˆ ρ  − MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b ˆ z (22) ⃗ F l  =  − F ρr  ˆ ρ  +   MR 2 2 ℓ ω h ω b ˆ z. (23) We see that the radial component of the force in unconstrained as long as it is equal and opposite according to equation (17). This is intuitive as the tension in the bar will transmit the force along the bar, while not affecting its motion. Less intuitive is the fact that, to get the bar to rotate in the   ˆ ϕ direction, you must apply forces in the  ˆ z  direction. This is the nature of a gyroscope — applying a force creates motion in a perpendicular direction. ',\n",

       " {'question': 'We aim to model the trajectory of a car driving along a bumpy road in the following way. A point mass of mass  m  (representing the body of the car) moves forwards with a constant horizontal velocity  v x . The mass is connected to a spring with spring constant  k  and equilibrium length  ℓ 0  (representing the shocks of the car). At the end of the spring, there is a massless wheel (representing a wheel of the car) with a negligibly small radius relative to the the other distances in the problem. The road has the shape of a cosine with bumps of height  H  and length  L  and at time  t  = 0  the wheel drops into the first bump (as shown below).

We are told that the road has a cosine height profile given by y r ( x ) =  C 1  cos ( C 2 x )  , (1) where  C 1  and  C 2  are unknown constants that we must determine from the geometry of the road. Note that, by taking the form of equation (1), we are implicitly choosing the  y  location of the origin to be halfway between the top and bottom of the bumps.  C 1  quantifies the height of the bumps. Since the maximum and minimum of the cosine function are  1  and  − 1  respectively, the total change in elevation 6 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - Solutions to Problem Set 13 of equation (1) is  2 C 1 . Since the physical change in elevation (from trough to peak) is  H , we have H  = 2 C 1 , which implies that C 1  =   H 2   . (2) Next, we see that  C 2  quantifies the length of the bump. From the problem statement, we know that, if you are at the peak of a bump, you will arrive at the next peak by traveling a horizontal distance  L . Similarly, if you are at a maximum of the cosine function, you will find the next maximum by increasing the argument of the cosine function by  2 π  (as the cosine function is  2 π  periodic). We must choose  C 2 such that these two periodic behaviors correspond to one another. Thus, if  x  =  L  the argument of the cosine function should be  2 π . Looking at equation (1), this means that  2 π  =  C 2 L  and we find C 2  =  2 π L  .

The equation of motion for the car comes from Newton’s second law ⃗ F net  =   ⃗ F g  +   ⃗ F s  =  m⃗ a c , (8) where ⃗ F g  =  − mg ˆ y (9) is the gravitational force, ⃗ F s  =  − k ∆ y ˆ y (10) is the spring force, and the  c  subscript indicates it refers to the body of the car. The challenge is to determine  ∆ y , the extension of the spring relative to its equilibrium length. First, we will let  y c  denote the height of the car, which is a function of time. From the picture in the problem statement, we see that, at any instant, the length of the spring will be  ℓ =  y c  − y w . Given that the equilibrium length is ℓ 0 , we have that ∆ y  =  ℓ − ℓ 0  =  y c  − y w  − ℓ 0 . (11) Substituting equations (9), (10), and (11) into the  ˆ y  component of equation (8) gives − mg  − k ∆ y  =  ma c ⇒ − mg  − k  ( y c  − y w  − ℓ 0 ) =  m d 2 y c dt 2  .

(14) 3. Equation (14) is a complicated differential equation, but we can recognize it as the simple harmonic oscillator equation with the addition of forcing terms (i.e. all the terms on the right side of the equation). To attack this, we first let ω 0  = r k m (15) ω d  =  2 πv x L (16) to get the simpler and more familiar form of d 2 y c dt 2  +  ω 2 0 y c   =  ω 2 0 H 2  cos ( ω d t ) +  ω 2 0 ℓ 0   − g. (17) You can solve this equation by looking it up in the Math Review document on the course Moodle. However, here we will show how to solve it directly. This differential equation is similar to an equation we solved in lecture 13a, but there are extra constant terms. Because these terms are constant, we can eliminate them by defining a new vertical coordinate  Y c  such that ω 2 0 Y c   =  ω 2 0 y c   − ω 2 0 ℓ 0   +  g ⇒ ω 2 0 y c   =  ω 2 0 Y c   +  ω 2 0 ℓ 0   − g. (18) Taking two derivatives of this equation yields ω 2 0 d 2 y c dt 2  =  ω 2 0 d 2 Y c dt 2 ⇒ d 2 y c dt 2  =  d 2 Y c dt 2  . (19) Substituting equations (18) and (19) into equation (17) gives d 2 Y c dt 2  +  ω 2 0 Y c   +  ω 2 0 ℓ 0   − g  =  ω 2 0 H 2  cos ( ω d t ) +  ω 2 0 ℓ 0   − g ⇒ d 2 Y c dt 2  +  ω 2 0 Y c   =  ω 2 0 H 2  cos ( ω d t )  , (20) where we see that the two offending terms have been eliminated. This is now identical to the differential equation solved in lecture 13a, so long as we identify that the notation in class corresponds to  x  =  Y c , λ  = 0 , and  F d /m  =  ω 2 0 H/ 2 . Thus, the solution is Y c  ( t ) =  A 1 e iω 0 t   +  A 2 e − iω 0 t   +   H 2 ω 2 0 ω 2 0   − ω 2 d cos ( ω d t )  .

This is the full solution to the differential equation of equation (14). Note that the first two terms correspond to oscillation, which can be seen through applying Euler’s formula  exp( ix ) = cos( x ) +  i  sin( x )  . However, this oscillation occurs at the natural angular frequency  ω 0  of the system and is independent of the characteristics of the bumps. This oscillation would occur on flat ground, if the body of the car was displaced a bit vertically. The problem statement asks us about the oscillations caused by the bumps. These are represented by the third term, which we see depends on the height of the bumps as well as their length (through equation (16)). Studying this term, we can see that the amplitude of the vertical oscillations caused by the bumps is ∆ y c  =   H 2 ω 2 0 ω 2 0   − ω 2 d . (23) Thus, the ride would be least comfortable when  ω 2 d   =  ω 2 0   because the amplitude of the vertical oscillation would become infinite, which represents resonance.

(14) We can substitute this into equation (12) to find ω 2 0   − ω 2 1   − \\x14 1 t 1  − t 0 ln \\x12 A  ( t 0 ) A  ( t 1 ) \\x13\\x15 2 = 0 ⇒ ω 0  = s ω 2 1   + \\x14 1 t 1  − t 0 ln \\x12 A  ( t 0 ) A  ( t 1 ) \\x13\\x15 2 . (15) Using the relationship between the frequency and angular frequency  ω  = 2 πf , this becomes 2 πf 0  = s (2 πf 1 ) 2   + \\x14 1 t 1  − t 0 ln \\x12 A  ( t 0 ) A  ( t 1 ) \\x13\\x15 2 ⇒ f 0  =  f 1 s 1 + \\x14 1 2 πf 1 1 t 1  − t 0 ln \\x12 A  ( t 0 ) A  ( t 1 ) \\x13\\x15 2 .

(17) Thus, given the number of significant digits in the numerical input quantities, we find that air has a negligible effect on the frequency of the tunning fork f 0  = 400  Hz . (18) 10 ',\n",

       " {'question': 'A uniform solid wheel, of mass  m  and radius  R , rolls without sliding on a horizontal table. It is pulled at its axis by an inextensible wire, which passes around a pulley and connects to a suspended block (see figure) with the same mass  m . The wire and pulley have negligible masses and the wire always remains tight. The system is initially at rest. 1. What is the speed of the center of mass of the wheel after it has moved forwards by a distance  d ? 2. Since the wheel does not slip, what can we say about the value of the static friction coefficient  µ s between the wheel and the table? m m R 1 Rotation, translation, and rolling - Problem Set 14 ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'y b x w T T mg mg F f N x y z 1. Consider the system composed of the wheel and the block (i.e. the two objects in the problem that move and have mass). Since we are asked about the state of the system at a particular  position  (i.e. after the center of the wheel has traveled a distance  d ), it is best to use conservation of energy. If we were asked about the system after a given amount of time  t , it would be easiest to use Newton’s laws. The forces on the wheel are gravity   ⃗ F gw  =  mg ˆ y , the normal force from the table   ⃗ N  =  − N  ˆ y , and the tension from the wire   ⃗ T  =  T  ˆ x . Additionally, we can infer that there must be a static friction force F f  ≤ µ s N  in the  − ˆ x  direction, in order for the wheel to roll without slipping. The forces on the block are gravity   ⃗ F gb  =  mg ˆ y  and the tension force from the wire   ⃗ T  =  − T  ˆ y . The tension in the wire at the block must be equal in magnitude to the tension at the wheel as both the rope and pulley are massless. Since tension is an internal force that does not dissipate any energy, the only nonconservative forces that could be doing work on the system are the normal force   ⃗ N  and the friction force   ⃗ F f . However, since the wheel is rolling without slipping, both forces are not being applied over a distance, just at a changing but always stationary point. This is analogous to a box sitting on a table. You can push the box slightly and static friction will keep it at rest by opposing the applied force. In this case, friction does no work as the box is stationary the entire time, so the force is applied over zero distance. Another way to see this is by considering the power  P  =   ⃗ F  ·  ⃗ v . Since the velocity of the point of the wheel in contact with the ground is  ⃗ v  = 0 , the power is clearly  P  = 0 . Since the power  P  =  dW/dt is also the time derivative of the work  W , the work must be a constant value throughout the motion of the block. Since the amount of work done by the friction and normal forces on the wheel is zero initially (as the system has yet to start to move), this means they never do any work. Thus mechanical energy is conserved throughout the motion of the system. 1 Rotation, translation, and rolling - Solutions to Problem Set 14 The total mechanical energy of the system is given by E m  =  K rot w +  K trans w +  K trans b +  U gb ⇒ E m  =   I w 2   ω 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 b   − mgy b (1) ⇒ E m  =   m 4   R 2 ω 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 b   − mgy b , (2) where  K rot w is the rotational kinetic energy of the wheel,  K trans w is the translational kinetic energy of the wheel,  K trans b is the translational kinetic energy of the falling block,  U gb  is the gravitational potential energy of the block, I w  =   m 2   R 2 (3) is the moment of inertia of the uniform solid wheel rotating about its center,  ω w  is the angular speed of the wheel,  v w  is the speed of the center of mass of the wheel,  v b  is the speed of the block, and we have defined a Cartesian coordinate system as shown in the figure above. Using the no-slip condition, we know that the speed of the center of the wheel is v w  =  Rω w ⇒ ω w  =   v w R  . (4) Substituting this into equation (2) gives E m  =   m 4   R 2  \\x10 v w R \\x11 2 +   m 2   v 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 b   − mgy b ⇒ E m  =  3 4 mv 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 b   − mgy b . (5) Since the wire is inextensible and we have carefully defined our coordinate system such that  x w  = 0 and  y b  = 0  initially, we can see the constraint condition is  y b  =  x w . Taking a derivative in time gives v b  =  v w . (6) Substituting these two relations into equation (5) gives E m  =  3 4 mv 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 w   − mgx w   = 5 4 mv 2 w   − mgx w . (7) Now we can apply conservation of mechanical energy between the initial state (when everything is at rest) and the final state (when the center of the wheel has moved by a distance  x w  =  d ) to find 0  − 0 =  5 4 mv 2 w   − mgd, (8) where we have take the reference point for the gravitational potential energy of each object to be their initial location. Solving for the final velocity of the center of the wheel gives v w  = r 4 5 gd. (9) 2. For the wheel not to slip, the static friction force must not exceed its maximum magnitude of F f  ≤ µ s N. (10) Drawing a free body diagram for the wheel and looking at Newton’s second law in the vertical direction shows that the normal force has a magnitude of  N  =  mg . Thus, we find F f  ≤ µ s mg. (11) 2 Rotation, translation, and rolling - Solutions to Problem Set 14 By rearranging we find that the coefficient of static friction must be sufficiently high to satisfy µ s  ≥ F f mg  , (12) otherwise the wheel will slip. In order to determine  F f , we must analyze the entire system. We can apply Newton’s second law to the wheel to get the equation X F wx  =  ma w ⇒ T  − F f  =  m dv w dt ⇒ T  =  F f  +  m dv w dt (13) in the horizontal direction, where  a w  is the acceleration of the center of the wheel. Applying Newton’s second law to the falling block and substituting equation (13) gives X F by  =  ma b ⇒ mg  − T  =  m dv b dt ⇒ mg  − F f  − m dv w dt   =  mdv b dt  . (14) From the constraint condition of equation (6), we find mg  − F f  − m dv w dt   =  mdv w dt ⇒ mg  − F f  = 2 m dv w dt ⇒ dv w dt   =  g 2   − F f 2 m . (15) Lastly, applying Newton’s second law for the rotational motion of the wheel about its center gives X ⃗ τ w  =  I w ⃗ α w ⇒ R ˆ y  ×   ⃗ F f  =  I w dω w dt   ˆ z ⇒ R ˆ y  ×  ( − F f  ˆ x ) =  I w dω w dt ⇒ F f  =   I w R dω w dt (16) in the  ˆ z  direction, where  ⃗ α w  is the angular acceleration of the wheel (which is the derivative of the angular velocity  ⃗ ω w ). There are no other torques on the wheel because tension and gravity act at the pivot point and the normal force is anti-parallel to the position vector to its point of application (i.e. the cross product in the torque evaluates to zero). Substituting equations (3), (4), and (15) into equation (16) gives F f  =  1 R \\x10 m 2   R 2 \\x11 \\x12  1 R dv w dt \\x13 =   m 2 \\x12 g 2   − F f 2 m \\x13 =  1 4 mg  − 1 4 F f , (17) which can be rearranged to show F f  =  1 5 mg. (18) Substituting this into equation (12) reveals the condition on the static coefficient of friction to be µ s  ≥ 1 5  = 0 . 2 . (19) This is quite a fundamental solution as we see that it is independent of the mass  m  and radius  R . The main requirement for it to be applicable is that the wheel and block must have the same mass. 3 Rotation, translation, and rolling - Solutions to Problem Set 14 ',\n",

       " {'question': 'A donkey starts pulling the cart shown below with a constant horizontal force of  F d  = 180  N. The cart has four solid wheels, each of which have a diameter of  d  = 70  cm, a mass of  m  = 12  kg, and a uniform mass density. The mass of the cart without the wheels is  M  = 120  kg.

       "  'answer': 'F d N a mg F f N a mg N g F f x y z N a N g 1. Due to the symmetry of the system, the free body diagram for all of the wheels is identical and is shown above. There are four forces on each wheel: gravity acting at the center of mass of the wheel (i.e. the center of the wheel), the normal force from the axle of the cart, the normal force from the ground, and the static friction force from the ground. 2. To approach this problem, it is best to first think about which objects are moving together and the different types of motion that are occurring. Since the wheels and the body of the cart are attached via the axles, the translational motion of the centers of the wheels and the cart must be identical. Thus, we can consider the cart-wheels system as a whole and write Newton’s second law in the horizontal direction as X  ⃗ F  = ( M  + 4 m ) ⃗ a ⇒ F d  − 4 F f  = ( M  + 4 m )  a, (1) where  a  is the acceleration of the cart as well as the centers of the wheels. Note that all other forces are internal forces within the cart-wheels system, so they cancel due to Newton’s third law. However, there is one other type of motion, which is the rotation of the wheels. Enforcing the no- slip condition will allow us to relate the frictional force causing the rotation of the wheels with the translational motion of the whole cart. We start by writing Newton’s second law for the rotation of a single wheel in the  ˆ z  direction as X ⃗ τ  =  I w ⃗ α ⇒ ⃗ R f  ×   ⃗ F f  =   m 8   d 2 ⃗ α ⇒ \\x12 − d 2  ˆ y \\x13 × ( − F f  ˆ x ) =  − m 8   d 2  dω dt   ˆ z ⇒ F f  =   m 4   ddω dt  ,  (2) where  I w  =  m ( d/ 2) 2 / 2 =  md 2 / 8  is the moment of inertia of the wheel about its axle,  ⃗ α  is the angular acceleration of the wheel,   ⃗ R f  is the position vector from the axle to the point of application of the friction force, and  ω  is the angular velocity of the wheel in the  ˆ z  direction. The condition for rolling without slipping is given by ω  = v d/ 2 , (3) where  v  is the translational velocity of the center of the wheel (as well as the cart as a whole). Substituting this into equation (2) gives F f  =   m 4   d \\x12 2 d dv dt \\x13 =   m 2   a. (4) Substituting this into equation (1) allows us to find F d  − 4 \\x10 m 2   a \\x11 = ( M  + 4 m )  a ⇒ F d  = ( M  + 6 m )  a ⇒ a  = F d M  + 6 m . (5) 4 Rotation, translation, and rolling - Solutions to Problem Set 14 Since the acceleration is constant, it is straightforward to integrate this to find that the velocity is v ( t ) =  at  +  v 0  =  at  = F d M  + 6 m t, (6) where the problem statement tells us that the initial velocity is  v 0  = 0 . Plugging in the numerical values into equations (5) and (6) gives  a  = 0 . 94  m/s 2   and  v  = 2 . 8  m/s after  t  = 3  seconds respectively. 3. To calculate the required coefficient of static friction to enable rolling without slipping, we first must calculate the magnitude of the static friction force. This can be found by substituting equation (5) into equation (4) to see F f  =   m 2 F d M  + 6 m . (7) We then require that this force be less than the maximum possible static friction force F f  ≤ µ s N g ⇒ m 2 F d M  + 6 m   ≤ µ s N g ⇒ µ s  ≥ m 2 1 N g F d M  + 6 m . (8) The normal force can be found through the vertical component of Newton’s second law on the entire cart-wheels system according to X  ⃗ F  = ( M  + 4 m ) ⃗ a ⇒ 4 N g  − F g  = 0 ⇒ 4 N g  − ( M  + 4 m )  g  = 0 ⇒ N g  =  1 4  ( M  + 4 m )  g  (9) as the acceleration in the  ˆ y  direction is zero. Substituting this into equation (8) gives µ s  ≥ m 2 4 ( M  + 4 m )  g F d M  + 6 m ⇒ µ s  ≥ 2 m M  + 4 m F d ( M  + 6 m )  g  . (10) Plugging in the numerical values from the problem statements yields µ s  ≥ 0 . 014 . (11) Remarkably, we see that the diameter of the wheel has no influence on the answer. ',\n",

       "  'answer': 'x x  = 0 x  =  x eq mg F s k 1. We will choose to use a one-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with the origin defined to be the location of the ceiling. If the spider were located at  x  = 0 , the spring would have a length of zero. 5 Rotation, translation, and rolling - Solutions to Problem Set 14 Thus, the equilibrium position  of the spring  is at  x  =  L , but this is different than the equilibrium position  of the spider  (due to the presence of the gravitational force). We show a free body diagram above, but note that the spring force can point either up or down depending on the location of the spider. The equilibrium position of the spider  x eq  is where the sum of the forces are equal to zero (i.e. the acceleration is  a  = 0 ). This is the definition of “equilibrium.” Using Newton’s second law and the form of the spring force F s  =  k  ( x  − L )  , (1) we find mg  − F s  = 0 ⇒ mg  − k  ( x eq  − L ) = 0 ⇒ x eq  =  L  +   m k  g, (2) where we know that for equilibrium the spring force must be pointing up to counteract gravity. 2. The equation of motion is also found from Newton’s second law, but allowing the spider to be at other positions than the equilibrium position (such that the acceleration  a  is not necessarily zero). At any arbitrary  x  location, Newton’s second law is mg  − F s  =  ma ⇒ mg  − k  ( x  − L ) =  m d 2 x dt 2 ⇒ d 2 x dt 2  +  k m x  =  k m L  +  g. (3) This is the equation of motion for the spider. 3. The problem statement tells us that the general solution to equation (3) has the form x ( t ) =  A  cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) +  x. (4) We can find the values of the constants by substituting equation (4) into equation (3). We start by taking the first and second derivatives to find the velocity and acceleration of the spider to be v ( t ) =   dx dt   =  − Aω 0  sin ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) (5) a ( t ) =   d 2 x dt 2  =  − Aω 2 0   cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) (6) respectively. Substituting equations (4) and (6) into equation (3), we find − Aω 2 0   cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) +  k m   ( A  cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) +  x ) =  k m L  +  g (7) ⇒ \\x12  k m   − ω 2 0 \\x13 A  cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) =   k m L  +  g  − k m x. (8) To solve this equation, we note that the time  t  is an independent parameter and equation (8) must be satisfied for all values of  t . This means that we can separate the equation based on terms with different functional dependences on time (i.e. the terms proportional to  cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ )  and those constant with t ) and require them to zero independently (e.g. equations (9) and (11) below). Equivalently, we can simply evaluate equation (8) at  t  = ( π/ 2  − φ ) /ω 0  to find \\x12  k m   − ω 2 0 \\x13 A  cos \\x12 ω 0 \\x12 π/ 2  − φ ω 0 \\x13 +  φ \\x13 =   k m L  +  g  − k m x ⇒ 0 =   k m L  +  g  − k m x (9) ⇒ x  =  L  +   m k  g, (10) where we note from equation (2) that  x  =  x eq . Then we can substitute this result into equation (8) at any arbitrary time  t  to get \\x12  k m   − ω 2 0 \\x13 A  cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) =   k m L  +  g  − k m \\x10 L  +   m k  g \\x11 ⇒ \\x12  k m   − ω 2 0 \\x13 A  cos ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) = 0 (11) ⇒ k m   − ω 2 0   = 0 ⇒ ω 0  = r k m . (12) 6 Rotation, translation, and rolling - Solutions to Problem Set 14 4. The problem states that at time  t 0  the velocity of the spider is  v ( t 0 ) = 0  and the spring does not exert a force on the spider. We can use equation (5) to see that the first condition is equivalent to v ( t 0 ) = 0 =  − Aω 0  sin ( ω 0 t 0  +  φ ) ⇒ 0 = sin ( ω 0 t 0  +  φ )  . (13) The sine function evaluates to zero when its argument equals  nπ  for some integer  n  ∈ Z . We are free to arbitrarily choose any integer value of  n  as they all satisfy the equation. This implies that ω 0 t 0  +  φ  =  nπ ⇒ φ  =  nπ  − ω 0 t 0 . (14) Using equations (1) and (4), we see that the second condition corresponds to F s  ( t 0 ) = 0 =  k  ( x  ( t 0 )  − L ) ⇒ x  ( t 0 ) =  L ⇒ A  cos ( ω 0 t 0  +  φ ) +  x  =  L. (15) The condition  x  ( t 0 ) =  L  makes sense. It is saying that, if the force exerted by the spring is zero at t  =  t 0 , the spider must be starting at the equilibrium position  of the spring  L . Substituting equations (10) and (14) gives A  cos ( ω 0 t 0  + ( nπ  − ω 0 t 0 )) + \\x10 L  +   m k  g \\x11 =  L ⇒ A  cos ( nπ ) =  − m k  g (16) ⇒ A  ( − 1) n   =  − m k  g ⇒ A  =  − ( − 1) n  m k  g ⇒ A  =  ± m k  g. (17) This indicates that there are two possible solutions: the plus sign (corresponding to odd values of  n ) or the minus sign (corresponding to even values of  n ). However, we can show that these two solutions are physically identical. If we take the solution with the positive sign (i.e. choosing any odd value of n ) and substitute it into equation (4) along with equation (14), we can determine the position to be x ( t ) = \\x10 m k  g \\x11 cos ( ω 0 t  + ( nπ  − ω 0 t 0 )) +  x  =   m k  g  cos ( ω 0  ( t  − t 0 ) +  nπ ) +  x. (18) In the same way, we can determine the position corresponding to the solution with the negative sign (i.e. choosing any even value of  n ) to be x ( t ) = \\x10 − m k  g \\x11 cos ( ω 0 t  + ( nπ  − ω 0 t 0 )) +  x  =  − m k  g  cos ( ω 0  ( t  − t 0 ) +  nπ ) +  x (19) =   m k  g  cos ( ω 0  ( t  − t 0 ) +  nπ  +  π ) +  x  =  m k  g  cos ( ω 0  ( t  − t 0 ) + ( n  + 1)  π ) +  x (20) using a trigonometric identity to remove the negative sign out in front. The only difference between equation (18) and equation (20) is the choice of  n , which is arbitrary. Thus, without loss of generality, we can take  n  = 1  meaning that equations (14) and (17) become φ  =  π  − ω 0 t 0 (21) A  =   m k  g. (22) 5. The maximum speed of the spider can be found by substituting equation (22) into equation (5) to get v ( t ) =  − \\x10 m k  g \\x11 ω 0  sin ( ω 0 t  +  φ )  . (23) The maximum of this function occurs at the time that  sin ( ω 0 t  +  φ ) =  − 1 . This leads to a maximum speed of v ( t ) =   m k  gω 0  =  m k  g r k m   =  g r m k  , (24) where we have used equation (12). 7 Rotation, translation, and rolling - Solutions to Problem Set 14 6.

       "  'answer': 'To help visualize the problem, we will start by drawing the situation, which we show in figure 1(a). Here  x t is the position of the tortoise,  x h  is the position of the hare, and it is helpful to define the following times: •  t 0  = 0  (the time at which the race starts), •  t 1  (the time at which the tortoise reaches the bridge, which is when the hare starts to accelerate), and •  t 2  (the arrival time of the tortoise and hare). To sketch the plot, we first consider the tortoise. It has a constant velocity throughout the entire race. A constant velocity corresponds to a position that is linear with time, so we can draw a straight line between the points  ( t  =  t 0 , x  = 0)  and  ( t  =  t 2 , x  =  L ) . The trajectory of the hare is a bit more complicated. The hare starts at a constant velocity that is slower than that of the tortoise and maintains the constant velocity until  t  =  t 1 . Thus, we can draw a straight line between the points  ( t  =  t 0 , x  = 0)  and  ( t  =  t 1 , x  =  L ′ ) , where the slope of the line is less than that of the tortoise’s. At this moment, the hare begins to accelerate with a constant positive acceleration. This means the slope of the line is constantly increasing.

       "  'answer': 'The motion of the train can be broken into three time intervals: 1. acceleration (for a duration of 60 s), 2. constant speed (for a duration of 300 s), and 3. deceleration (for a duration of 120 s). Given the information from the problem, we can directly calculate the acceleration in each time interval to be a 1  =  ∆ v 1 ∆ t 1 =  72  km hr   − 0  km hr 1  min = 72 km hr-min   × 1  hr 60  min   ×  1  min 60  s   ×  1  min 60  s   ×  1000  m 1  km =  1 3 m s 2 a 2  =  ∆ v 2 ∆ t 2 =  72  km hr   − 72  km hr 5  min = 0 a 3  =  ∆ v 3 ∆ t 3 =   − ∆ v 1 2∆ t 1 =  − 1 2 a 1  =  − 1 6 m s 2  , where the subscript refers to the first, second, and third time intervals respectively. In figure 4, we use these values to plot the acceleration as a function of time. 6 Motion in one dimension - Solutions to Problem Set 1 Figure 4: The acceleration of the train (in m/s 2 ) as a function of time (in s). Given that we know the acceleration, it is natural to calculate the velocity next. We will denote the velocity throughout each of the time intervals by  v i ( t ) , where the subscript  i  equals  1 ,  2 , or  3  and refers to the first, second, or third time interval respectively. Similarly, we will denote the initial velocity of the  i th   time interval to be  v 0 ,i . During all time intervals the acceleration is constant, so we can apply equations (1) and (2) from problem 4. Equation (1) becomes v i ( t ) =  a i t  +  v 0 ,i , (6) where  a i  is the acceleration during the time interval that we have calculated above. Importantly, using the form of equation (1) requires that we define the start of each time interval to be  t  = 0 . This means that we are defining a separate time coordinate system for each time interval. Keeping track and correctly handling these different time coordinates is one of the most challenging parts of the problem. It is possible to calculate everything on a single time coordinate, but the mathematics become more complicated. Since the train started with  v 0 , 1  = 0 , during the first time interval equation (6) is v 1 ( t ) =  a 1 t  = \\x12 1 3 m s 2 \\x13 t. Therefore, at the interface between time intervals 1 and 2, the train is traveling at  v 1 (60  s ) = 20  m / s  =  v 0 , 2 . Substituting this initial velocity and  a 2  = 0  into equation (6), we see that the velocity during the second interval is a constant value of v 2 ( t ) =  v 0 , 2  = 20   m s   . Thus, the initial condition for the third time interval is  v 2 (300  s ) = 20  m / s  =  v 0 , 3 , so v 3 ( t ) =  a 3 t  +  v 0 , 3  = \\x12 − 1 6 m s 2 \\x13 t  + 20   m s   . To produce the plot for velocity we need to combine these three results. However, we must remember to account for the different time coordinate systems by shifting the second time interval by 60 s and the third time interval by 300 s + 60 s = 360 s. This gives figure 5. Lastly, we can calculate the positions analogously to the velocities, using equation (2) instead of equation (1). We see that the position during each time interval changes quadratically as a function of time according to x i ( t ) =  1 2 a i t 2  +  v 0 ,i t  +  x 0 ,i , (7) 7 Motion in one dimension - Solutions to Problem Set 1 Figure 5: The velocity of the train (in m/s) as a function of time (in s). where  x 0 ,i  is the initial position of the train during the  i th   time interval. Again, we are defining a separate time coordinate for each time interval such that the start of every time interval is  t  = 0 . We will take x  =  x 0 , 1  = 0  to be the initial location of the train at the start of the first time interval. We showed above that  v 0 , 1  = 0 , so during the first time interval equation (7) becomes x 1  =  1 2 \\x12 1 3 m s 2 \\x13 t 2   = \\x12 1 6 m s 2 \\x13 t 2 . At the interface between time intervals 1 and 2, the train is located at  x 1 (60  s ) = 600  m  =  x 0 , 2 . Given that we found  v 0 , 2  = 20  m / s above, the position throughout the second time interval is x 2  = \\x10 20   m s \\x11 t  + 600  m . At the interface between time intervals 2 and 3, the train is located at  x 2 (300  s ) = 6600  m  =  x 0 , 3 . Given that  v 0 , 3  = 20  m / s from above, the position throughout the third time interval is x 3  =  1 2 \\x12 − 1 6 m s 2 \\x13 t 2   + \\x10 20   m s \\x11 t  + 6600  m . Again combining the three time intervals, shifting the second and third in time by 60 s and 360 s respectively, we produce figure 6. 8 Motion in one dimension - Solutions to Problem Set 1 Figure 6: The position of the train (in m) as a function of time (in s). 9 ',\n",

At what position does the collision occur? 4. What is the minimum speed  v 0  required to ensure the stone and the cheese collide? ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Crow Fox O x y v 0 α L H g 1,2. We start by taking the diagram provided with the question and defining the angle  α  as well as a convenient coordinate system. The origin  O  is the position of the fox, the angle  α  defines the direction of the initial velocity of the stone relative to the  x  axis, the  y  axis is defined to be anti-parallel to  ⃗ g , and the  x  axis is defined to be in the direction of the initial horizontal velocity of the stone. Both objects experience projectile motion, so we can directly write their equations of motion. For the stone we have x s   ( t ) =  v s x 0 t  +  x s 0 and y s   ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  v s 0 y t  +  y s 0 . Similarly, for the cheese we have x c   ( t ) =  v c x 0 t  +  x c 0 and y c   ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  v c 0 y t  +  y c 0 . The initial conditions of the stone are  x s 0   = 0 ,  y s 0   = 0 ,  v s x 0   =  v 0   cos  α , and  v s y 0   =  v 0   sin  α , while the initial conditions of the cheese are  x c 0   =  L ,  y c 0   =  H ,  v c x 0   = 0 , and  v c y 0   = 0 . Substituting these values gives x s   ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  α (1) y s   ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  v 0 t  sin  α (2) 1 Ballistics - Solutions to Problem Set 2 for the stone and x c   ( t ) =  L (3) y c   ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  H. (4) for the cheese. For the stone and cheese to collide, there must be a single time  t  =  t coll  for which they are at the exact same position. We can write this condition as x s   ( t coll ) =  x c   ( t coll ) (5) and y s   ( t coll ) =  y c   ( t coll )  . (6) Substituting the equations of motion for the stone and cheese from above, equation (5) becomes v 0 t coll  cos  α  =  L, which implies that t coll  = L v 0  cos  α . Using basic trigonometry and the Pythagorean theorem, the figure above shows that  cos  α  =  L/ √ L 2   +  H 2 . Substituting this gives t coll  = √ L 2   +  H 2 v 0 . (7) In the  y  direction we use equation (6), which is − 1 2 gt 2 coll   +  v 0 t coll   sin  α  =  − 1 2 gt 2 coll   +  H. Crucially, we see that the gravitational acceleration terms on both sides cancel and gravity disappears from the problem, leaving v 0 t coll  sin  α  =  H. Solving for the time and using trigonometry to show  sin  α  =  H/ √ L 2   +  H 2 , we find that t coll  = H v 0  sin  α   = √ L 2   +  H 2 v 0 . (8) We see that the collision times we calculated in equations (7) and (8) are identical. This means we really do have a collision – the stone and cheese are at the same  x  and  y  location at the same time. This occurs at time t coll  = √ L 2   +  H 2 v 0 . Note that the fact that there is a collision does not depend on the value of  v 0  nor  g ! 3. The position of the collision can be found by substituting the collision time  t coll  back into the equations of motion. Using equation (1) or (3), the  x  position is simply x s   ( t coll ) =  x c   ( t coll ) =  L. (9) Using equation (2) or (4) and a bit of algebra, we find that the  y  location of the collision is y s   ( t coll ) =  y c   ( t coll ) =  − 1 2 gt 2 coll   +  H  =  − g 2 L 2   +  H 2 v 2 0 +  H. (10) 2 Ballistics - Solutions to Problem Set 2 4. Above, we have shown that the stone and cheese always collide, without posing any restriction on the initial speed of the stone. However, in reality there is a restriction to impose – if the initial speed is not large enough, the stone will hit the ground before it hits the cheese. This does not contradict the above derivation – for low initial speeds the above derivation simply predicts that the collision would take place underground (i.e. at  y <  0 ). In order for the collision to take place above ground, we must enforce that y c   ( t coll )  >  0 . Using equation (10), this is equivalent to − g 2 L 2   +  H 2 v 2 0 +  H >  0 . Rearranging, we see that the constraint on the initial speed is v 0  > r g  L 2  +  H 2 2 H . ',\n",

Note that the dropped stone is subject to no acceleration. Again find the time for the stone to hit the deck and the distance it lands from the foot of the mast.  Hint: write the equation of motion for the stone as well as for the foot of the mast. ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'For parts 1 and 2 of this problem, we choose a coordinate system at rest with respect to the land when the boat is docked. The  z  axis is parallel to the mast and the  x  axis is horizontal (i.e. along to the ground). The origin corresponds to the foot of the mast at time  t  = 0 , when the stone is dropped. In part 3, we choose a 7 Ballistics - Solutions to Problem Set 2 frame of reference relative to the fixed stars. The idea is to have a frame of reference that is fixed while the sailboat or the stone moves. In this problem, it is crucial to realize that the initial velocity of the dropped stone is equal to the velocity of the sailboat at the precise moment when the stone is dropped. 1. The dropped stone undergoes constant acceleration due to gravity  g  in the downwards direction. Thus, we can apply the equations of projectile motion z stone  ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  v z 0 t  +  z 0 . Given our coordinate system, the initial conditions of the stone are  v z 0  = 0  and  z 0  =  h . Thus, the equation of motion for the stone is z stone  ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  h. The time it takes the stone to reach the foot of the mast  t fall  is determined by the condition z stone  ( t fall ) = 0 , so we find t fall  = s 2 h g  . The dimensions are consistent as  [ s ] = p [ m ] / [ m / s 2 ]  as required. The distance that the stone lands relative to the foot of the mast is given by d  =  | x stone  ( t fall )  − x foot  ( t fall ) |  = 0 , where  |  . . .  |  is the absolute value (or magnitude) of the quantity within and  x foot ( t )  is the horizontal location of the foot of the mast. In the horizontal direction, the equation of motion for the stone is x stone ( t ) =  v x 0 t  +  x 0 . (27) However, since the initial conditions are  v x 0  = 0  and  x 0  = 0 , we find simply x stone ( t ) = 0 . Likewise, since the sailboat has no motion in the  x  direction, the equation of motion for the foot of the mast is also  x foot ( t ) = 0 . Thus, we find d  = 0 . 2. Since the velocity of the sailboat is solely in the  x  direction, the equation of motion in  z  is identical to that of part 1, z stone  ( t ) =  h  − 1 2 gt 2 . Therefore, the time it takes for the stone to land remains t fall  = s 2 h g  . Now, since the sailboat moves with a constant velocity in the horizontal direction, the equation of motion in  x  for the foot of the mast is changed to x foot  ( t ) =  v 0 t. 8 Ballistics - Solutions to Problem Set 2 However, the horizontal motion of the stone is also changed. Since the girl is riding the moving sailboat, when she drops it with no initial velocity  in her reference frame , it has an velocity  ⃗ v 0  with respect to the reference frame of the land (in which we are doing the calculation). Thus, equation (27) becomes x stone  ( t ) =  v 0 t. Nevertheless, the distance the stone lands relative to the foot of the mast remains unchanged d  =  | x stone  ( t fall )  − x foot  ( t fall ) |  =  v 0 t fall  − v 0 t fall  = 0 . 3. Again, you must determine the equations of motion for the stone and the foot of the mast in the  z  and x  directions. In this part, we take a frame of reference at rest relative to the stars. As soon as the stone is released, it no longer experiences the constant acceleration. Thus, in the  z  direction, the stone follows z stone  ( t ) =  v 0 t  +  h, where we have already substituted the initial velocity and position of the stone. In the  x  direction, the stone has no initial motion or acceleration, so it follows x stone  ( t ) = 0 . The foot of the mast stays with the ship and continues to experience constant acceleration, so it follows z foot ( t ) =  1 2 at 2  +  v 0 t. The mast has no motion in the  x  direction, so x foot ( t ) = 0 . The stone reaches the foot of the mast when z stone  ( t fall ) =  z foot ( t fall ) . Substituting the equations of motion for both sides gives v 0 t fall  +  h  =  1 2 at 2 fall   +  v 0 t fall . Therefore, t fall  = r 2 h a  . Since  a  =  g , the time it takes the stone to reach the foot of the mast  t fall  remains the same as in parts 1 and 2. The distance the stone lands relative to the foot of the mast is still given by d  =  abs  ( x stone  ( t fall )  − x foot  ( t fall ))  , so, as before, the stone falls at the foot of the mast d  = 0 . 9 Ballistics - Solutions to Problem Set 2 ',\n",

       " {'question': 'The tortoise and the hare are racing a distance  L  along a straight track. The tortoise and hare start with constant velocities,  v t  and  v h  respectively. The hare is not taking this race seriously, so its velocity is less than the tortoise’s. Once the tortoise arrives at a bridge a distance  L ′   < L  from the start, the hare realizes it could lose and accelerates with a constant acceleration  a . Express this problem mathematically. Find the condition on  a  that will allow the hare to win the race. Check your result in terms of units. Brainstorm limiting cases for which you have clear intuition about the solution. In these limiting cases, does your expression for  a  make sense? ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'In this problem we take as given the length of the race  L , the distance to the bridge  L ′ , the velocity of the tortoise  v t , and the initial velocity of the hare  v h . We must calculate the accelerate  a  needed for the hare to win the race. As in problem 3 of problem set 1, we will define  t 0  = 0  as the time the race starts,  t 1  as the time at which the tortoise reaches the bridge (which is when the hare starts to accelerate), and  t 2  as the arrival time of the tortoise. Additionally, can also define the time durations  ∆ t  =  t 1  − t 0  and  ∆ t ′   =  t 2  − t 1  of the first and second phases of the race respectively. We draw a schematic of the race in the figure below, where  x t  is the position of the tortoise and  x h  is the position of the hare. h During both phases of the race, the tortoise travels at the same constant speed  v t . Given that we have defined the origin to be its initial position, the tortoise’s equation of motion is x t ( t ) =  v t t. Thus, it reaches the bridge when x t ( t 1 ) =  L ′   =  v t t 1 , so t 1  =   L ′ v t . (28) Similarly, the tortoise reaches the finish line when x t ( t 2 ) =  L  =  v t t 2 , so t 2  =   L v t . (29) During the first phase of the race (from  t 0  to  t 1 ), the hare maintains a constant speed  v h . Thus, its equation of motion is x h ( t ) =  v h t. However, when the  tortoise  reaches the bridge at time  t 1 , the  hare’s  motion changes to constant acceleration a . At  t 1 , the hare’s velocity is still  v h  and we can calculate its position to be x h ( t 1 ) =  v h t 1 . By substituting equation (28), we find x h ( t 1 ) =  L ′  v h v t . 10 Ballistics - Solutions to Problem Set 2 The general equation of motion for constant acceleration can be found by integration (as we have done for the vertical direction of projectile motion) to be x h ( t ) =   a 2 t 2  +  v h 0 t  +  x h 0 . From our analysis of the first phase, we know the initial position of the second phase is  x h 0  =  L ′ v h /v t , while the initial velocity of the second phase is  v h 0  =  v h . Therefore, the equation of motion becomes x h ( t ) =   a 2 t 2  +  v h t  +  L ′  v h v t . Note that in this equation we have adopted a new time coordinate system, defined such that the time  t  = 0 corresponds to the start of the second phase of the race. Given this, we know that the hare must arrive at the finish line  x  =  L  at a time  t  =  t 2  − t 1  after the start of the second phase in order to tie the tortoise. This corresponds to the condition x h ( t 2  − t 1 ) =   a 2 ( t 2  − t 1 ) 2  +  v h ( t 2  − t 1 ) +  L ′  v h v t =  L. Using equations (28) and (29) to replace  t 1  and  t 2 , we find a 2 \\x12  L v t − L ′ v t \\x13 2 +  v h \\x12  L v t − L ′ v t \\x13 +  L ′  v h v t =  L. This equation contains only  a  and known quantities. To produce the simplest expression, we will first multiply the entire equation by  2 v 2 t   to find a  ( L  − L ′ ) 2   + 2 v t v h  ( L  − L ′ ) + 2 v t L ′ v h  = 2 v 2 t   L. Rearranging produces a  ( L  − L ′ ) 2   = 2 v 2 t   L  − 2 v t v h L. Finally, simplifying further yields the solution of a  =  2 v t L  ( v t  − v h ) ( L  − L ′ ) 2 . Therefore, in order for the hare to win the race, it must accelerate faster than this, producing the condition that a >   2 v t L  ( v t  − v h ) ( L  − L ′ ) 2 . To verify our result, we can check the units h m s 2 i = \\x02  m s \\x03 [ m ] \\x02  m s \\x03 [ m ] 2 . We can also check the following limiting cases. Limiting case 1 : The tortoise has an initial velocity that is much greater than that of the hare. For this, we expect that the acceleration of the hare must be very large in order to beat the tortoise. Mathematically, we write this as  v t  →∞ . In this case the acceleration becomes lim v t →∞ a  = lim v t →∞ 2 v t L  ( v t  − v h ) ( L  − L ′ ) 2 =  ∞ 11 Ballistics - Solutions to Problem Set 2 Limiting case 2 : The tortoise and the hare have an equal velocity before the bridge. For this we expect that the hare does not need to accelerate at all in order to tie the race. Mathematically, we write this as v t  =  v h . We see that a  =  2 v t L  ( v t  − v h ) ( L  − L ′ ) 2 = 0 . Limiting case 3 : The bridge is situated close to the finish line, making the second phase of the race very short. For this we expect that the hare’s acceleration will need to be very large in order to win the race. Mathematically, we write this as  L ′   → L . We see that lim L ′ → L   a  = lim L ′ → L 2 v t L  ( v t  − v h ) ( L  − L ′ ) 2 =  ∞ . 12 Ballistics - Solutions to Problem Set 2 ',\n",

       "  'answer': 'We choose to use a coordinate system where  x  points east,  y  points north, and  z  is vertical and points to the sky. The origin of the coordinate system coincides with the initial position of the ball. Figure 1: Cartoon of dynamics in the reference frame of the ship a. The ship sails with a constant velocity, so the only acceleration in the entire system is due to gravity. Thus, in the ship frame the ball undergoes projectile motion, which has equations of motions given by x s ( t ) =  v x 0 t  +  x 0 y s ( t ) =  v y 0 t  +  y 0 z s ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  v z 0 t  +  z 0 in the reference frame of the ship. Given the choice of the origin of our coordinate system,  x 0  =  y 0  = z 0  = 0 . Additionally, since the ball is thrown from the ship due east, the initial velocity  v y 0  = 0 . Using the above diagram and trigonometric identities, we see that  v x 0  =  v b  cos  θ  and  v z 0  =  v b  sin  θ . Substituting these initial conditions yields x s ( t ) =  v b t  cos  θ y s ( t ) = 0 z s ( t ) =  − 1 2 gt 2  +  v b t  sin  θ. These equations represent a parametric form for the trajectory.

(4) The only horizontal force on the books is the static friction force  f s , which is equal to its maximum value of  f s  =  µ s N b  when Carl is applying the maximum force for which the books do not slide. By applying Newton’s second law in the  ˆ x  direction, we find X F  =  ma ⇒ f s  =  ma ⇒ µ s N b  =  ma ⇒ a  =   µ s N b m  .

       "  'answer': 'As indicated in the title, this problem is challenging. We start by defining the coordinate system such that y  is upwards in the vertical direction and  x  is in the horizontal direction of the initial velocity of the ball. The origin is located at the position where the ball is kicked. We will denote the initial speed of the ball by  v bi , which we know must be less than  v max bi . Using our general solution for projectile motion along with the initial position ( x 0  = 0  and  y 0  = 0 ) and velocity ( v x 0  =  v bi  cos  α  and  v y 0  =  v bi  sin  α ), we can write the equations of motion for the ball as ⃗ a b ( t ) =  − g ˆ y (7) ⃗ v b ( t ) =  v x 0 ˆ x  + ( − gt  +  v y 0 ) ˆ y  =  v bi  cos  α ˆ x  + ( − gt  +  v bi  sin  α ) ˆ y (8) ⃗ r b ( t ) = ( v x 0 t  +  x 0 ) ˆ x  + \\x10 − g 2 t 2  +  v y 0 t  +  y 0 \\x11 ˆ y  =  v bi t  cos  α ˆ x  + \\x10 − g 2 t 2  +  v bi t  sin  α \\x11 ˆ y. (9) 1. We want to find the distance at which the player catches the ball. To do so, we must first find the time at which the ball returns to the ground, which we will call  t 1 . The condition for the ball returning to the ground is  y b ( t 1 ) = 0 , so we can substitute the  ˆ y  component of equation (9) to find y b ( t 1 ) = 0 =  − g 2 t 2 1   +  v bi t 1   sin  α. (10) This equation has two solutions,  t 1  = 0  and t 1  =  2 v bi g sin  α. (11) The first solution corresponds to the time of the kick and the second corresponds to the catch, so the second solution is what we’re looking for. By substituting this time into the equation for the horizontal position of the ball from equation (9), we can find the distance at which the ball lands to be x b ( t 1 ) =  v bi t 1  cos  α  =  2 v 2 bi g sin  α  cos  α. (12) Now we must analyze the player’s motion. Since she runs at a constant velocity (that we will call  v p ) and her initial position is at the origin, her position is given by x p ( t ) =  v p t. (13) Thus, at time  t  =  t 1  her position is x p ( t 1 ) =  v p t 1  =  2 v bi v p g sin  α, (14) 5 Free body diagrams - Solutions to Problem Set 3 where we have made use of equation (11). The ball and the player must be at the same location for a catch to occur, which we will call  ℓ = x b ( t 1 ) =  x p ( t 1 ) . Thus, we require equations (12) and (14) to be equal, which allows us to determine the initial angle of the ball v bi  cos  α  =  v p ⇒ cos  α  =   v p v bi ⇒ α  = arccos \\x12  v p v bi \\x13 . (15) To use this information to find a simple expression for  ℓ , we can draw the triangle implied by this equation (shown below). After using the Pythagorean theorem to find that the length of the missing v p v bi α side is q v 2 bi   − v 2 p , we see that sin  α  = q v 2 bi   − v 2 p v bi . (16) Substituting this result into equation (14) (or equation (12)) gives ℓ =  2 g  v p q v 2 bi   − v 2 p . (17) This is the expression for the distance at which the ball lands, which we want to maximize. To do so, we can immediately see that we want to increase the initial velocity of the ball as much as possible by setting v bi  =  v max bi . (18) This is also intuitively obvious. The harder you kick the ball, the more time it will be in the air and the more time the player will have to run. The dependence on  v p  is more complicated. We see that increasing it will increase the multiplying factor in front of the square root (thereby increasing  ℓ ), but it will also decrease the quantity in the square root (thereby decreasing  ℓ ). To find the maximum, we can remember our past analysis of projectile motion. The maximum vertical position occurred where the vertical velocity (which is the derivative of the vertical position) went to zero. This is a general technique to find the extrema (i.e. both maxima and minima) of functions: calculate the derivative and solve for the locations at which it is zero. Thus, we take equation (17) and calculate dℓ dv p = 0 =  2 g q v 2 bi   − v 2 p   + 2 g  v p \\uf8eb \\uf8ed 1 2 − 2 v p q v 2 bi   − v 2 p \\uf8f6 \\uf8f8 =  2 g q v 2 bi   − v 2 p   − 2 g v 2 p q v 2 bi   − v 2 p = 2 g q v 2 bi   − v 2 p \\x00 v 2 bi   − 2 v 2 p \\x01 (19) using the chain rule and product rules. Simplifying this expression, we find that there is only one extrema and it occurs at v p  =   v bi √ 2 . (20) 6 Free body diagrams - Solutions to Problem Set 3 Substituting this result into equation (17) and comparing with any other choice of  v p  (e.g.  v p  = 0 ), we can verify that this extrema is, in fact, a maxima (as opposed to a minima). Thus, this is the optimal speed that the player would ideally run at. If this isn’t possible because  v p  =  v bi / √ 2  > v max p , the player should run as close as possible to this value, namely at their maximum speed of  v max p . Therefore, we have to explicitly distinguish these two possibilities by writing v p  = \\x1a v max p if  v bi / √ 2  > v max p v bi / √ 2 otherwise   . (21) Combining equations (17), (18), and (21), we find that the maximum distance to catch the ball is ℓ = ( (2 v max p /g ) q ( v max bi ) 2   − ( v max p ) 2 if  v max bi / √ 2  > v max p ( v max bi ) 2 /g otherwise . (22) Combining equations (15), (18), and (21), we find that ideal angle to kick the ball is α  = \\x1a arccos \\x00 v max p /v max bi \\x01 if  v max bi / √ 2  > v max p arccos \\x00 1 / √ 2 \\x01 =  π/ 4 = 45 ◦ otherwise . (23) The interpretation of these results is that if you are sufficiently fast (i.e.  v max p is sufficiently large), the second case in all three equations applies. In this case, you want to kick the ball at  α  = 45 ◦ , as this is the angle that maximizes the distance traveled by the ball, and run below your maximum speed, such that you arrive at the same time and place as the ball when it lands. However, the more realistic case is the first, that you can out-kick your running speed. In this case you want to run at your maximum speed and angle your kick higher (i.e.  α >  45 ◦ ) so that the ball stays in the air for longer and you have more time to run. 2. The position of the ball is given by equation (9). Using equations (15) and (16), we can write equation (9) as ⃗ r b ( t ) =  v p t ˆ x  + \\x10 − g 2 t 2  +  t q v 2 bi   − v 2 p \\x11 ˆ y.

The elevator undergoes an unknown constant acceleration  a  for a time  t 1 . Then the elevator moves at a constant velocity for a time interval  ∆ t 2  = 4 t 1 . Finally, the elevator brakes with a deceleration of the same magnitude as the initial acceleration for a time interval  ∆ t 3  =  t 1 , until stopping at the sixth floor. Assume the gravitational constant is given as  g . Find the magnitude of the acceleration. 1. Sketch the position, velocity, and acceleration as a function of time. 2.

       "  'answer': '1. The acceleration, velocity, and position as a function of time are plotted below. 2. There are three stages of motion given in the problem and we note that the problem is one-dimensional. The first and third stages are at constant acceleration and the second stage is at constant velocity. We have seen similar problems before. The connection between the stages is that the final speed after the first stage is the constant speed during the second stage and the initial speed for the third stage. Additionally, the position at the end of the first stage is the initial position for the second stage and the position at the end of the second stage is the initial position for the third stage. 3. From projectile motion, we know the general solution for the acceleration, velocity, and position during any constant acceleration  a  is a ( t ) =  a v ( t ) =  at  +  v 0 8 Free body diagrams - Solutions to Problem Set 3 y ( t ) =   a 2 t 2  +  v 0 t  +  y 0 respectively. During the first stage the acceleration is  a  =  a . Thus, after a time interval  t 1  the elevator has an upward speed and displacement of v 1  =  v ( t 1 ) =  at 1 ∆ y 1  =  y ( t 1 )  − y 0  =   a 2 t 2 1 respectively, where we must remember that the acceleration  a  is positive and unknown. During the second stage, the elevator has a constant acceleration of  a  = 0 , so the upward speed and displacement are v ( t ) =  v 0  =  v 1  =  at 1 y ( t )  − y 0  =  v 0 t  =  v 1 t  =  at 1 t, where we note that here  t  is the time since the second stage began. Thus, after a time interval  ∆ t 2  = 4 t 1 the elevator has a velocity and displacement of v 2  =  v (∆ t 2 ) =  at 1 ∆ y 2  =  y (∆ t 2 )  − y 0  = 4 at 2 1 . During the third stage, we have constant acceleration of  a  =  − a , so the upward speed and displacement are v ( t ) =  − at  +  v 0  =  − at  +  at 1 y ( t )  − y 0  =  − a 2 t 2  +  v 0 t  =  − a 2 t 2  +  at 1 t. After a time interval  ∆ t 3  =  t 1 , the upward speed and displacement is v 3  =  v (∆ t 3 ) = 0 ∆ y 3  =  y (∆ t 3 )  − y 0  =  − a 2 t 2 1   +  at 1 t 1   =  a 2 t 2 1 respectively. Thus, the total distance traveled is the sum of the displacements in the three stages and is also equal to the height of the building  h , so h  = ∆ y 1  + ∆ y 2  + ∆ y 3  =   a 2 t 2 1   + 4 at 2 1   +  a 2 t 2 1   = 5 at 2 1 . Solving this equation for the acceleration gives the solution of a  =   h 5 t 2 1 . 4. Let’s assume that the sixth floor is about  h  ≈ 25  m above the ground. This happens to be a slow elevator, taking approximately  30  s to reach the top so  t 1  ≈ 5  s. Therefore, the acceleration is: a  ≈ 25  m 5  ×  (5  s ) 2  ≈ 0 . 2  m s 2  . This number is reasonable as it is around 2% of the gravitational acceleration. In a slow elevator, one barely notices that the elevator is accelerating. 9 ',\n",

       "  'answer': '1. In this part, the static friction can be considered to be  F s  ≈ 0  because the coefficient of static friction is so small. As we are analyzing circular motion, we choose a cylindrical coordinate system as shown in the figure below, where the unit vector  ˆ ρ  points in the outward radial direction,   ˆ ϕ  points into the page around the curve, and  ˆ z  points upwards. The free body diagram on the car is also shown. α R v N mg z ρ ϕ Given the free body diagram and the form of the centripetal acceleration  ⃗ a  =  − ( v 2 0 /R )ˆ ρ  for circular motion, Newton’s second law   P  ⃗ F  =  m⃗ a  in the  ˆ ρ  direction is − N  sin  α  =  − mv 2 0 R  . We can tell that the trigonometric function in this equation is sine rather than cosine by imagining the case that  α  = 0 . If  α  = 0 , the  ˆ ρ  component of   ⃗ N  would be 0. Since  sin(0) = 0  and  cos(0) = 1 , the  ˆ ρ component of   ⃗ N  should contain  sin( α ) . In the  ˆ z  direction Newton’s second law is N  cos  α  − mg  =  ma z . Because the car is traveling in a circle and does not slide up or down, the acceleration in the  ˆ z  direction is zero  a z  = 0 . Thus, the components of Newton’s second law become N  sin  α  =   mv 2 0 R and N  cos  α  =  mg. Dividing these equations to eliminate  N  yields tan  α  =   v 2 0 Rg  , which we can solve for the speed  v 0  that is necessary to maintain circular motion. We find v 0  = p Rg  tan  α. 1 Circular motion - Solutions to Problem Set 4 2. We now reconsider the problem with a non-zero coefficient of static friction  µ s . In this part, the speed of the car  v  =  v min  is so slow that it just barely doesn’t slip down the bank. The static friction force must point up the incline as we know that it is preventing the car from slipping down. The free body diagram on the car is shown in the figure below, from which we see that Newton’s second law is − N  sin  α  +  F s  cos  α  =  − mv 2 R in the  ˆ ρ  direction and N  cos  α  +  F s  sin  α  − mg  =  ma z in the  ˆ z  direction. α R v N mg F s z ϕ ρ When  v  =  v min , the car still isn’t slipping so the acceleration in the  ˆ z  direction  a z  = 0  is still zero, but the static friction has its maximum magnitude of  F s  =  µ s N . Thus, Newton’s second law becomes − N  sin  α  +  µ s N  cos  α  =  − mv 2 min R and N  cos  α  +  µ s N  sin  α  =  mg. Dividing these equations to eliminate  N  yields − sin  α  +  µ s  cos  α cos  α  +  µ s  sin  α =  − v 2 min Rg  , which can then be solved for the minimum speed necessary to avoid sliding down the embanked turn v min  = s Rg   sin  α  − µ s  cos  α cos  α  +  µ s  sin  α   = r Rg   tan  α  − µ s 1 +  µ s  tan  α . The limiting cases of this result can be checked. In the limit  µ s  → 0 ,  v min  → √ Rg  tan  α , which is consistent with the result for part 1. In the limit  µ s  → tan  α ,  v min  → 0 , which is the solution for the static case of a block sitting on an incline. 3. We now consider the case where the car is at the maximum speed  v  =  v max  such that it is almost slipping up the inclined plane. For this case, the direction of static friction now points down the incline plane and the free body diagram is shown below. The analysis is identical to the previous case, except the static friction force changes sign. Thus Newton’s second law become − N  sin  α  − F s  cos  α  =  − mv 2 R (1) in the  ˆ ρ  direction and N  cos  α  − F s  sin  α  − mg  = 0 (2) 2 Circular motion - Solutions to Problem Set 4 α R v N mg F s z ϕ ρ in the  ˆ z  direction. When  v  =  v max , the static friction has its maximum value of  F s  =  µ s N , so Newton’s second law becomes − N  sin  α  − µ s N  cos  α  =  − mv 2 max R and N  cos  α  − µ s N  sin  α  =  mg. Dividing these two equations to eliminate  N  yields − sin  α  − µ s  cos  α cos  α  − µ s  sin  α =  − v 2 max Rg  , which can then be solved for the maximum speed  v max  to avoid sliding up the embanked turn v max  = s Rg   sin  α  +  µ s  cos  α cos  α  − µ s  sin  α   = r Rg   tan  α  +  µ s 1  − µ s  tan  α . This solution is identical to that of part 2, except the sign in front of  µ s  is opposite. The figure below shows a plot of  v 2 / ( Rg )  versus  µ s  when  α  = 45 ◦ . The shaded area represents the set of  ( µ s , v 2 / ( Rg ))  points where the car remains in a circular path.

The analysis is the same as in part 3, but the magnitude of the static friction is less than its maximum value. However, now the problem statement gives us the velocity  v  as a known quantity. Hence, we can combine equations (1) and (2) to eliminate  N  and solve for  F s .

       "  'answer': '1. The free body diagram for the ball is shown below. Note the   ˆ ϕ  component of the tension arises because Sally’s hand does not stay in the center of the circle, so the string does not pull precisely in the radial direction. From the free body diagram, we see that Newton’s second law   P  ⃗ F  =  m⃗ a  in the radial g mg T ρ T ϕ θ direction is − T ρ  − mg  cos  θ  =  − mRω 2 , where we have used the fact that the centripetal acceleration needed for circular motion is  ⃗ a  =  − Rω 2 ˆ ρ . Rearranging, we find the tension to be T ρ  =  mRω 2   − mg  cos  θ. Because the angular frequency is related to the period through  ω  = 2 π/t 0 , the magnitude of the radial component of the tension in the string is T ρ ( θ ) =  4 π 2 mR t 2 0 − mg  cos  θ. 2. A string cannot push. Thus, the magnitude of the radial component of the tension in the string  T ρ must be greater than zero at all points in the circular motion. If  T ρ  <  0  the ball will move inwards and the path will no longer be circular. This means that, using the final result from part 1, circular motion will not be maintained if T ρ ( θ ) =  4 π 2 mR t 2 0 − mg  cos  θ <  0 4 Circular motion - Solutions to Problem Set 4 at any point along the trajectory. From this equation we see that  θ  = 0  (i.e. the top of the circle) is the most prone location to breakdown. This is because the gravitational term  − mg  cos  θ  makes its largest negative contribution to the required radial force  T ρ  (since  cos(0) = 1  is the maximum value of cos  θ ). Thus, taking  θ  = 0  and solving the above equation for the period  t 0  gives the condition for the breakdown of circular motion. We find that circular motion will  not  be maintained if t 0  >  2 π s R g  . ',\n",

       " {'question': 'A painter of mass  m 1  stands on a platform of mass  m 2  and pulls himself up by two ropes that run over massless, frictionless pulleys as shown. He pulls down on each rope with a force of magnitude  F  and accelerates upward with a uniform acceleration. Find this uniform acceleration  a . ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'We will explain two different, equally valid approaches to this question. The first method is to draw two separate free body diagrams, one for the painter and one for the platform (both shown below). Since the pulleys are both massless and frictionless, the tension throughout each rope is  F , the magnitude of the force the painter applies to each rope. The painter pulls the ropes downward, so the ropes exert an equal and opposite upward force on the painter by Newton’s third law. Thus, the tension from the ropes pull upwards on both the painter and the platform. Additionally, the platform exerts an upward normal force on the painter, the magnitude of which we denote as  N . By Newton’s third law, there is a reaction normal force from the painter on the platform, which has an equal magnitude  N  and is in the opposite direction. Lastly, there is a downwards gravitational force  m 1 g  on the painter and  m 2 g  on the platform. Painter y F F N m 1 g Platform F F N m 2 g Let  a 1  denote the magnitude of the acceleration of the painter and  a 2  denote the magnitude of the acceleration of the platform. Since the painter is standing on the platform, they both have the same acceleration upwards. Thus, we know a 1  =  a 2  =  a, (1) where we have denoted the common acceleration by the symbol  a . Applying Newton’s second law to the painter in the vertical direction gives 2 F  +  N  − m 1 g  =  m 1 a, (2) while applying Newton’s second law to the platform in the vertical direction gives 2 F  − N  − m 2 g  =  m 2 a. (3) By adding equations (2) and (3), we can eliminate the normal force entirely and find 4 F  − ( m 1  +  m 2 ) g  = ( m 1  +  m 2 ) a. (4) 1 Applications of Newton’s second law - Solutions to Problem Set 5 Solving for the acceleration gives the final answer a  =  4 F  − ( m 1  +  m 2 ) g m 1  +  m 2 = 4 F m 1  +  m 2 − g. (5) A second method to find the same solution is to treat the painter and platform as a single system as we know that they will move together. In this case, the internal forces do not appear in the free body diagram (shown below). The four ropes still act on the combined painter-platform system with the same upward vertical force. The gravitational force still pulls downwards, but acts on the total mass of the system  ( m 1  +  m 2 ) . y ( m 1  +  m 2 ) g Painter and Platform F F FF Applying Newton’s second law to the combined painter-platform system in the vertical direction gives 4 F  − ( m 1  +  m 2 ) g  = ( m 1  +  m 2 ) a. (6) This can be solved for the acceleration, yielding the same result as given in equation (5). ',\n",

       " {'question': 'g m 2 m 1 m 3 Consider the system shown above, where  m 1  > m 2 , the pulleys are massless and frictionless, the rope joining the blocks is massless and inextensible, and the downward acceleration of gravity is  g . The three blocks are made from the same material, as are two tables. As is typical, the coefficient of static friction between the blocks and the tables is greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction,  µ s  > µ k . 1. Imagine that, when the system is released from rest, you know block 3 accelerates downward with a constant magnitude  a , but only one of the other blocks moves. Which block does not move, and what is the magnitude and direction of the friction force holding it back? 2. Now consider the case where, after the blocks are released from rest, all three of them begin to move. Find the acceleration of all three blocks and the tension in the rope. 1 Applications of Newton’s second law - Problem Set 5 ',\n",
       "  'answer': '1. In this part, the vertical acceleration of block 3,  a 3 y  =  a , is a given quantity. Let  T  be the tension in the rope, which is constant throughout its length (as the rope is massless and the pulleys are massless and frictionless). The free body diagram on block 3 is shown below. Defining a coordinate system such that  ˆ y  points up (antiparallel to gravity), we find Newton’s second law becomes 2 T  − m 3 g  =  − m 3 a (1) for block 3. We can solve this to find the tension T  =  1 2 m 3 ( g  − a ) . (2) 2 Applications of Newton’s second law - Solutions to Problem Set 5 The problem tells us that the tension  T  exceeds the static friction force limit on one block, but not the other. To see which, we must calculate the static friction force, which requires us to know the normal forces. Thus, we draw the free body diagrams for both blocks (shown below), where  f 1  and  f 2 represent the friction force on each. We know that the friction force (whether it be static or kinetic) will point outwards as block 3 will tend to pull blocks 1 and 2 towards the pulleys. Since blocks 1 and 2 do not accelerate vertically, Newton’s second law in the vertical direction gives N 1  − m 1 g  = 0 ⇒ N 1  =  m 1 g (3) and N 2  − m 2 g  = 0 ⇒ N 2  =  m 2 g (4) for blocks 1 and 2 respectively. Substituting this into the equation for the static friction force gives f 1  ≤ µ s N 1  =  µ s m 1 g (5) and f 2  ≤ µ s N 2  =  µ s m 2 g, (6) where we have used the same coefficient of static friction in both equations as the two blocks (and the tables they sit on) are made of the same material. From this we conclude that block 1 does  not  move and block 2  does  move because the maximum static friction force is higher on block 1 since  m 1  > m 2 . Since block 1 does not move, we can write the horizontal component of Newton’s second law as T  − f 1  = 0 , (7) where we have defined  ˆ x  to point towards the right. Solving this equation for the friction force and substituting equation (2) gives the final answer — block 1 does not move and the friction force holding it back points horizontally to the left with magnitude f 1  =  1 2 m 3 ( g  − a ) . (8) Note we know that  g > a  as block 3 would only accelerate at  g  if it were in free fall. Any upwards force (such as that from the rope) would only serve to slow its downwards acceleration. 2. Now consider the case where, after being released from rest, all three blocks begin to move. We are trying to solve for the accelerations  a 1 x ,  a 2 x , and  a 3 y  as well as the tension  T  in the rope. Thus, to solve for these 4 unknowns we need four equations. The free body diagrams for all three blocks remain the same (shown above), though all the friction forces are kinetic friction as every block is now moving. For all objects, we will choose to use a single coordinate system with  ˆ y  pointing upward and  ˆ x  pointing to the right, though other choices are possible. Given this coordinate system, Newton’s second law for block 1 is T  − f 1  =  m 1 a 1 x (9) in the horizontal direction, while it is N 1  − m 1 g  = 0 (10) 3 Applications of Newton’s second law - Solutions to Problem Set 5 in the vertical direction (since there is no vertical acceleration). Therefore, as in part 1, we find N 1  =  m 1 g, (11) so the  kinetic  friction force is f 1  =  µ k N 1  =  µ k m 1 g. (12) Substituting this into equation (9) gives T  − µ k m 1 g  =  m 1 a 1 x . (13) Next, we consider block 2. Given its free body diagram (shown above), Newton’s second law is f 2  − T  =  m 2 a 2 x (14) in the horizontal direction, while it is N 2  − m 2 g  = 0 (15) in the vertical direction (since there is no vertical acceleration). Therefore, as in part 1, we find N 2  =  m 2 g, (16) so the  kinetic  friction force is f 2  =  µ k N 2  =  µ k m 2 g. (17) Substituting this into equation (14) gives µ k m 2 g  − T  =  m 2 a 2 x . (18) Lastly, we turn to block 3. Given its free body diagram (shown above), Newton’s second law is 2 T  − m 3 g  =  m 3 a 3 y (19) in the vertical direction and  0 = 0  in the horizontal direction. We can collect the equations for the three blocks (equations (13), (18), and (19)): T  − µ k m 1 g  =  m 1 a 1 x (20) µ k m 2 g  − T  =  m 2 a 2 x (21) 2 T  − m 3 g  =  m 3 a 3 y . (22) g x 1 x 2 m 2 m 1 m 3 y 3 y x s 3 s 2 s 1 4 Applications of Newton’s second law - Solutions to Problem Set 5 However, we are still missing one equation (given that we have four unknowns and only three equations). This is the constraint condition. More specifically, studying the geometry of the system (see the figure above), we see that the motion of the three blocks is related by a geometrical constraint: because the rope is inextensible (i.e. does not stretch), its length  L  is constant. However, quantifying its length is complicated given that the blocks move. There are many different approaches to do this, which will give the same answer. We choose to define a single coordinate system for all three blocks and place its origin equidistant between the center of the two fixed pulleys (as shown above). Then we quantify some missing fixed distances (e.g. the radii of the pulleys  R ), which, as we will see, won’t end up mattering as they don’t change as the blocks move. Finally, we can add up all the sections of rope to express the total length of the rope as L  = ( − x 1 + s 1 )+   π 2   R +( − y 3 + s 3 )+ πR +( − y 3 + s 3 )+  π 2   R +( x 2 − s 2 ) =  − x 1 + x 2 − 2 y 3 + s 1 − s 2 +2 s 3 +2 πR. (23) Note that we have accounted for the fact that some of the positions (e.g.  x 1  and  y 3 ) will be negative, given our definitions of  ˆ x  and  ˆ y . If we differentiate equation (23) twice with respect to time, we find 0 =  − a 1 x  +  a 2 x  − 2 a 3 y . (24) Note that all of the unknown distances, like  R  and  s 1 , have disappeared as they don’t change with time. Equation (24) is the equation that we were missing. We now have four equations (i.e. (20), (21), (22), and (24)) with which we can solve for the four unknowns ( a 1 x , a 2 x ,  a 3 y , and the tension  T ). We solve equation (20) to find a 1 x  =   T m 1 − µ k g, (25) equation (21) to find a 2 x  =  µ k g  − T m 2 , (26) and equation (22) to find a 3 y  =  2 T m 3 − g. (27) Substituting these three results into equation (24) gives 0 =  − \\x12  T m 1 − µ k g \\x13 + \\x12 µ k g  − T m 2 \\x13 − 2 \\x12  2 T m 3 − g \\x13 . (28) We rearrange this equation to find that the tension is T  = 2 g ( µ k  + 1) \\x10 1 m 1   + 1 m 2   + 4 m 3 \\x11 . (29) We can now substitute our solution for the tension to find the accelerations. Equation (25) becomes a 1 x  = 2 g ( µ k  + 1) \\x10 1 +   m 1 m 2   +  4 m 1 m 3 \\x11  − µ k g, (30) equation (26) becomes a 2 x  =  µ k g  − 2 g ( µ k  + 1) \\x10 m 2 m 1   + 1 + 4  m 2 m 3 \\x11 , (31) 5 Applications of Newton’s second law - Solutions to Problem Set 5 and equation (27) becomes a 3 y  = 4 g ( µ k  + 1) \\x10 m 3 m 1   +  m 3 m 2   + 4 \\x11  − g. (32) Note that the signs of these accelerations depend on the coordinate system used and so may be different in your solution. However, the tension given by equation (29) is a physical force and is independent of the choice of coordinates. ',\n",

       "  'answer': 'Given the circular motion of this problem, it is most convenient for us to use cylindrical coordinates. Since the rope has mass, the tension will  not  be constant along its length. However, since it is uniform, it has a constant linear mass density  λ  =  m 1 /ℓ , which is everywhere equal to the total mass of the rope  m 1  divided by its total length  ℓ . We can divide the rope into very small pieces of length  ∆ ρ  in the radial direction, which each have a mass of ∆ m  =  λ ∆ ρ  =   m 1 ℓ ∆ ρ. (1) z ℓ ρ T ( ρ  + Δ ρ ) T ( ρ ) ρ Δ ρ T ( ℓ ) Piece of rope Mass  m 2 We start by considering a piece of the rope that is located an arbitrary distance  ρ  from the shaft, whose free body diagram is shown above. The net radial force on the piece is equal to the difference between the tension on either side X F ρ  =  T ( ρ  + ∆ ρ )  − T ( ρ ) = ∆ T, (2) which is simply the change in tension across the piece  ∆ T . Given that the piece is executing uniform circular motion, we know it is experiencing a centripetal acceleration of  ⃗ a  =  − ρω 2 ˆ ρ . Thus, the radial component of Newton’s second law must be X F ρ  =  − ∆ mω 2 ρ. (3) Combining equations (1), (2), and (3) gives ∆ T  =  − ∆ mω 2 ρ  =  − m 1 ℓ ∆ ρω 2 ρ. (4) Dividing by  ∆ ρ , we see that ∆ T ∆ ρ   =  − m 1 ℓ ω 2 ρ. (5) 6 Applications of Newton’s second law - Solutions to Problem Set 5 In the limit that our very small pieces become infinitesimally small (i.e.  ∆ ρ  → 0 ), equation (5) becomes the differential equation dT dρ   =  − m 1 ℓ ω 2 ρ. (6) From this, we see immediately that the tension decreases with increasing radius as  m 1 ,  ℓ ,  ω 2 , and  ρ  are all positive quantities. We can solve this differential equation by direct integration of both sides of the equation according to Z  dT dρ  dρ  =  − m 1 ω 2 ℓ Z ρdρ. (7) This simplifies to T ( ρ ) =  − m 1 ω 2 2 ℓ ρ 2   +  C, (8) where  C  is an integration constant that we still need to determine. To find it, we need to determine the value of the tension at some location. To do so, we use the fact that the only radial force applied at the end of the rope is by the mass  m 2 . Using the free body diagram for mass  m 2  (shown above), we see that Newton’s second law in the radial direction is − T ( ℓ )ˆ ρ  =  − m 2 ω 2 ℓ ˆ ρ ⇒ T ( ℓ ) =  m 2 ω 2 ℓ.

From your reference frame (i.e. facing forwards in your car), what is the net force acting on your friend’s car? Which fictitious forces are contributing? What acceleration do you perceive her as having? 2 Applications of Newton’s second law - Problem Set 5 ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'The most challenging part of this problem is understanding and determining the physical meaning of each of the quantities from our derivation in class. In this solution we will simply state the physical meanings, but these can be seen and justified through the derivation presented in class. The first thing to note is that the mass of your own car  m 1  does not matter at all in this problem. We already know the motion of your car (and importantly the motion of the reference frame it defines) and we are not interested in calculating the forces on your car. Since the cars are executing circular motion, we can define a fixed cylindrical coordinate system  F  with the origin at the center of the circular curve and the  ˆ z  direction defined such that  ω 1  and  ω 2  are both in the positive  ˆ z  direction. Additionally, we observe that both cars are moving with the same angular velocity, which we will call  ⃗ ω  =  ω ˆ z  =  ω 1 ˆ z  =  v 1 /R 1 ˆ z  =  ω 2 ˆ z  =  v 2 /R 2 ˆ z . Next, we can write down the general coordinate system transformation for forces between the fixed inertial reference frame  F  and a non-inertial reference frame  N  rotating with an angular velocity  ⃗ ω 1 . As derived in class, it is Σ ⃗ F N  = Σ ⃗ F F  − m 2   ⃗ A F N  − 2 m 2 ⃗ ω 1  ×  ⃗ v N  − m 2 ⃗ α 1  ×  ⃗ r N  − m 2 ⃗ ω 1  ×  ( ⃗ ω 1  ×  ⃗ r N )  . (1) Here  Σ ⃗ F N  is the sum of the forces acting on your friend’s car, as perceived in the non-inertial reference frame N  (in this case defined by the motion of your car). This is what we want to determine in order to solve the problem. The quantity  Σ ⃗ F F  is the sum of the standard forces acting on your friend’s car in the fixed inertial reference frame  F  (i.e. someone standing at the center of the curve watching the cars drive by). In 7 Applications of Newton’s second law - Solutions to Problem Set 5 the inertial reference frame, your friend’s car is moving with uniform circular motion of radius  R 2 , so the sum of the forces acting on them must be a centripetal force Σ ⃗ F F  =  − m 2 ω 2 2 R 2 ˆ ρ. (2) In practice this would be provided by the static friction force between the car tires and the road. Note that all the masses that appear are  m 2  because we are only considering the forces acting on your friend’s car, which has mass  m 2 . The rest of the terms represent fictitious forces. The first is the translational acceleration fictitious force. The quantity   ⃗ A F N  is the acceleration of the reference frame  N , as seen from the fixed frame  F . Since the reference frame  N  is defined by your car and you are executing uniform circular motion in frame  F , we know that the acceleration must be centripetal ⃗ A F N  =  − ω 2 1 R 1 ˆ ρ. (3) Note that the angular speed and radius are that of  your  car (i.e.  ω 1  and  R 1 ). The next term is the Coriolis force, which includes the velocity of your friend’s car  ⃗ v N  as seen by you in frame N . Intuitively, since both cars are traveling with the same angular velocity  ω 1  =  ω 2 , from your perspective your friend’s car is staying stationary beside you. Her position relative to you would be a constant vector pointing outwards ⃗ r N  = ( R 2  − R 1 )ˆ ρ. (4) Then, taking a derivative in time justifies our intuitive argument that ⃗ v N  = 0 . (5) Note, in this step we have considered the unit vectors to be constant as we are determining how the position changes with time from the perspective of you within the reference frame  N . In other words, from your perspective facing forwards in your car (i.e. continuously facing in the   ˆ ϕ  direction) and believing yourself to be at rest, your friend’s position is not changing with time. Thus, the Coriolis force is zero. The next term is the Euler force, where  ⃗ α 1  = ˙ ω 1 ˆ z  is the angular acceleration of reference frame  N . Since you are driving at a constant speed,  ˙ ω 1  = 0 , so  ⃗ α 1  = 0  and the Euler force disappears. The final term is the centrifugal force, where we have already determined that the position of your friend’s car from your perspective in frame  N  is given by equation (4). Thus, the centrifugal force is non-zero and equation (4) can be substituted into equation (1). Collecting all of the results from above, we can rewrite equation (1) as Σ ⃗ F N  =  − m 2 ω 2 2 R 2 ˆ ρ  +  m 2 ω 2 1 R 1 ˆ ρ  − m 2 ω 1 ˆ z  ×  ( ω 1 ˆ z  ×  ( R 2  − R 1 )ˆ ρ )  . (6) Using the fact that  ω  =  ω 1  =  ω 2  and taking the scalars out in front of the cross products allows us to simplify to Σ ⃗ F N  =  − m 2 ω 2 ( R 2  − R 1 )ˆ ρ  − m 2 ω 2 ( R 2  − R 1 )ˆ z  ×  (ˆ z  ×  ˆ ρ )  . (7) In the right-handed  ( ρ, ϕ, z )  coordinate system, we can use the right hand rule to see that  ˆ z  ×  ˆ ρ  =  ˆ ϕ  and ˆ z  ×  (ˆ z  ×  ˆ ρ ) = ˆ z  ×   ˆ ϕ  =  − ˆ ρ , so Σ ⃗ F N  =  − m 2 ω 2 ( R 2  − R 1 )ˆ ρ  +  m 2 ω 2 ( R 2  − R 1 )ˆ ρ  = 0 . (8) Thus, from your perspective in the non-inertial reference frame  N  of your car, you see no net force acting on your friend’s car. This differs from a fixed reference frame  F , in which you would observe a physical centripetal force (provided by static friction between your friend’s car and the road) as given by equation (2). The lack of a net force in frame  N  arises from a cancellation between the physical centripetal force, the translational acceleration fictitious force, and the centrifugal fictitious force. 8 Applications of Newton’s second law - Solutions to Problem Set 5 Since the net force is zero, Newton’s first or second laws tells us that the acceleration  ⃗ a N  is zero. Newton’s first and second laws (but not the third) are still valid in non-inertial reference frames, as long as all of the fictitious forces are properly included. Alternatively,  ⃗ a N  = 0  can be seen by taking the time derivative of equation (5). 9 Applications of Newton’s second law - Solutions to Problem Set 5 ',\n",

As the angular speed increases, which coin slips first or do they both slip at the same instant? What is the maximum angular speed  ω max   such that no slipping occurs? R ω 3 ',\n",
       "  'answer': '1. We choose to use a cylindrical coordinate system (because of the circular motion). For this part of the problem, it would be more efficient to analyze the situation by considering the two coins as a single combined object, which enables us to ignore internal forces (e.g. the normal and friction forces between the two coins). However, it will be helpful for the second part of this problem to treat the two coins separately. Thus, we will start by drawing separate free body diagrams for each coin (shown below). We have the weight of each coin  m⃗ g , the forces of static friction between the coins (both action   ⃗ f bt and reaction   ⃗ f tb  =  − ⃗ f bt ), the force of static friction from the turntable on the bottom coin   ⃗ f gb , the normal forces between the coins (both action   ⃗ N bt  and reaction   ⃗ N tb  =  − ⃗ N bt ), and the normal force of the turntable on the bottom coin   ⃗ N gb . Here the top coin is denoted by the  t  subscript, the bottom coin by  b , and the turntable by  g . R ω ρ z ϕ Top coin N bt f bt mg Bottom coin N gb f tb mg N tb f gb To determine the magnitude of the radial force exerted by the turntable on the bottom coin   ⃗ f gb , we will apply Newton’s second law to each coin. A key point is that the static friction between the coins form an action-reaction pair, so the static friction that makes the top coin accelerate inward also acts to push the bottom coin radially outward. The radial component of Newton’s second law for the bottom coin is f tb  − f gb  =  − mRω 2 , (1) where we’ve used that the centripetal acceleration is  ⃗ a  =  − Rω 2 ˆ ρ . The radial component of Newton’s second law on the top coin is given by − f bt  =  − mRω 2 ⇒ f bt  =  mRω 2 . (2) Since the static friction force of the bottom coin on the top coin  f bt  and the static friction force of the top coin on the bottom coin  f tb  are an action-reaction pair, Newton’s third law requires that their magnitudes respect  f bt  =  f tb . Substituting this into equation (2) gives f tb  =  mRω 2 . (3) 10 Applications of Newton’s second law - Solutions to Problem Set 5 Then substituting equation (3) into equation (1) yields mRω 2   − f gb  =  − mRω 2 . (4) Hence the turntable exerts a inward radial force on the bottom coin with a magnitude of f gb  = 2 mRω 2 . (5) Comparing with equation (2), we see that the static friction force on the bottom coin from the turntable is twice as large as the static friction force on the top coin. 2. When two surfaces slip, it is because the static friction force required to hold them in place has exceeded its maximum possible strength of  f   max   =  µN . To calculate this, we must first find the magnitude of the normal force  N  between the relevant surfaces. Applying Newton’s second law to the top coin in the vertical  ˆ z  direction yields N bt  − mg  = 0 , (6) where we note that none of the objects in this problem are accelerating vertically so  a z  = 0 . Thus, we can calculate the normal force of the bottom coin on the top coin to be N bt  =  mg. (7) Since this force forms an action-reaction pair with the normal force of the top coin on the bottom coin, we know that their magnitudes follow  N tb  =  N bt  =  mg . Substituting equation (7) into the form of the static friction force, we see that the top coin will slip when the static friction between the two coins reaches its maximum value of f   max bt =  µ 2 N bt  =  µ 2 mg. (8) We then substitute this result into equation (2) to find µ 2 mg  =  mR  ( ω max t ) 2   , (9) where  ω max t is the maximum angular speed for which the top coin does not slip. Rearranging this, we find ω max t = r µ 2 g R  . (10) Newton’s second law for the bottom coin in the  ˆ z  direction is N gb  − N tb  − mg  = 0 . (11) Noting again from Newton’s third law that  N tb  =  N bt  =  mg , we can rearrange this equation to show that the normal force between the turntable and the bottom coin is N gb  = 2 mg. (12) Using this and the form of the static friction force, we see that the bottom coin will slip when the static friction between it and the turntable exceeds f   max gb =  µN gb  = 2 µ 1 mg. (13) From equation (5), we can determine that the maximum angular speed after which the bottom coin slips will satisfy 2 µ 1 mg  = 2 mR  ( ω max b ) 2   .

Now suppose the rod is not uniform but has a mass density that varies linearly with the distance  x from the left end according to λ ( x ) =  λ 0 x L , where  λ 0  is a constant that has units of kg/m. The total mass of the rod is still  M . Find  λ 0  and the position of the center of mass with respect to the left end of the rod. Express your answer in terms of L ,  M , and  ˆ x . ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Δ m Δ x x x  =  L x 1. We start by choosing a coordinate system with the rod aligned along the  x -axis and the origin located at the left end of the rod. Next, we’ll decompose the rods into differential elements of mass  ∆ m  and consider the element located a distance  x  from the origin. Since the rod is uniform, the linear mass density is λ  =   M L (1) as well as λ  =  ∆ m ∆ x  , (2) where  ∆ x  is the length of the differential element. Taking the limit of equation (2) as  ∆ x  → 0  gives λ  =   dm dx  . (3) The center of mass for a continuous system is defined by ⃗ R CM  = R M   ⃗ rdm R M   dm , (4) where R M ( . . . ) dm  indicates an integral over the entire mass distribution of the whole object.

We will use the same coordinate system as in part 1 and again consider a differential mass element ∆ m  located a distance  x  from the origin. The linear mass density  λ ( x )  is no longer uniform along the length of the rod, so  λ  ̸ =  M/L  at every point. However, the definition of the local linear mass density is λ ( x ) = lim ∆ x → 0 ∆ m ∆ x  , (7) where  ∆ x  is the length of the differential element. Since the right side is the definition of the derivative, we have λ ( x ) =   dm dx  . (8) Substituting the functional form of the density from the problem statement gives dm dx   =  λ 0 x L .

       "  'answer': 'In this problem, we are tasked with finding the center of mass dynamics of the system that includes both the particle and the rod.

As for the center of mass acceleration, since the net external force on the system is zero we know that the center of mass acceleration is zero ⃗ F   ext net   =  M ⃗ A CM  = 0 ⇒ ⃗ A CM  = 0 . (3) Thus, due to the relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration, we know that the center of mass velocity is constant in time ⃗ V CM ( t ) =   ⃗ V CM (0) . (4) As an aside, for systems with constant mass, having a constant center of mass velocity ( ⃗ V CM ( t ) =  constant) is equivalent to conservation of momentum ( ⃗ p sys ( t ) =   P N i =1   m i ⃗ v i ( t ) =  constant) as equation (2) shows that ⃗ V CM ( t ) =  ⃗ p sys ( t ) /   P N i =1   m i . Next, if the center of mass velocity is constant, then we know that the center of mass position is linear in time ⃗ R CM ( t ) =   ⃗ V CM (0) t  +   ⃗ R CM (0) . (5) Thus, we just need to find the initial center of mass position   ⃗ R CM (0)  and initial center of mass velocity ⃗ V CM (0) . Since the problem statement gives us the state of the system at  t  = 0 , we can compute these quantities using equations (1) and (2). We will first calculate the center of mass position. At  t  = 0 , we can deduce that the center of mass of the rod is ⃗ r 1 (0) =   L 2  ˆ y (6) by symmetry. Alternatively, as in part 1 of problem 1 above, this could be found by integrating over the constant mass distribution  λ  =  M/L  =  dm/dy  of the rod according to ⃗ r 1 (0) = R M   ⃗ rdm R M   dm  = R  L 0   ⃗ rλdy R  L 0   λdy =   λ R  L 0   y ˆ ydy λ R  L 0   dy = R  L 0   ydy R  L 0   dy ˆ y  =  ( y 2 / 2] y = L y =0 ( y ] L 0 ˆ y  =   L 2 / 2  − 0 L  − 0 ˆ y  =   L 2  ˆ y, (7) where R M ( . . . ) dm  indicates an integral over the entire mass distribution of the whole object. At time  t  = 0 , the particle is at the origin, so its center of mass is at ⃗ r 2 (0) = 0 . (8) Thus, substituting equations (6) and (8) into equation (1), we see that the center of mass of the whole system at time  t  = 0  is ⃗ R CM (0) =  ( L/ 2)ˆ y  + 0 2 =   L 4  ˆ y. (9) The initial center of mass velocity can be found in a similar manner. The rod is at rest at  t  = 0 , so  ⃗ v 1 (0) = 0 . At time  t  = 0 , the particle is moving in the positive  x -direction with a velocity  ⃗ v 2 (0) =  V 0 ˆ x . Thus, equation (2) tells us that the velocity of the center of mass of the system at  t  = 0  is ⃗ V CM (0) =  0 +  V 0 ˆ x 2 =   V 0 2  ˆ x. (10) Thus, substituting equation (10) into equation 4 gives ⃗ V CM ( t ) =   V 0 2  ˆ x (11) and substituting equations (9) and (10) into equation 5 gives ⃗ R CM ( t ) =   V 0 2   t ˆ x  +   L 4  ˆ y.

At time  t 0 ,  m 1  has a velocity of magnitude  v 0  directed towards  m 2 , which is at rest a distance  d  away. At time  t 1 , the particles collide. Calculate  L , the distance traveled by particle 1 during the time interval  t 1  − t 0 .  Express your answer using some or all of the following variables:  m 1 ,  m 2 ,  t 0 ,  t 1 , v 0 , and  d . ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'We will start by choosing a coordinate system with the origin defined to be the location of  m 1  at  t  =  t 0 . This choice is sensible as we will then know that L  =  x 1 ( t 1 ) , (1) i.e. the position of  m 1  will be identical to the distance traveled since  t  =  t 0  (which is what the problem asks us to calculate). Additionally we note that the problem is one-dimensional, so we will only need to consider the  ˆ x  direction. Since there is no external force on the two-particle system, we know that the acceleration of the center of mass is zero, regardless of the force between the objects. Thus, we know that the center of mass velocity is constant in time V CM ( t ) = P N i =1   m i v i P N i =1   m i =   m 1 v 1 ( t ) +  m 2 v 2 ( t ) m 1  +  m 2 =  V CM ( t 0 ) (2) and, thus, doesn’t change from its value at  t  =  t 0 . This is significant because the problem statement gives us information about the system at  t  =  t 0 . Since the center of mass velocity is constant, we know that the center of mass position is linear in time. We can write it as X CM ( t ) = P N i =1   m i x i P N i =1   m i =   m 1 x 1 ( t ) +  m 2 x 2 ( t ) m 1  +  m 2 =  V CM ( t 0 )( t  − t 0 ) +  X CM ( t 0 ) , (3) where we have chosen the form of our linear function to depend only on quantities at  t  =  t 0 , again because that is the time that the problem statement gives us information about. To determine the center of mass velocity at  t  =  t 0 , we substitute the facts from the problem statement that v 1 ( t 0 ) =  v 0  and  v 2 ( t 0 ) = 0  into equation (2) to find V CM ( t 0 ) =   m 1 v 0  +  m 2 (0) m 1  +  m 2 = m 1 m 1  +  m 2 v 0 . (4) To determine the center of mass position at  t  =  t 0 , we substitute the facts from the problem statement that x 1 ( t 0 ) = 0  (due to the definition of our origin) and  x 2 ( t 0 ) =  d  into equation (3) to find X CM ( t 0 ) =   m 1 (0) +  m 2 d m 1  +  m 2 =  V CM ( t 0 )( t 0  − t 0 ) +  X CM ( t 0 ) ⇒ X CM ( t 0 ) = m 2 m 1  +  m 2 d. (5) Thus, substituting equations (4) and (5) into (3), we find the center of mass position as a function of time to be X CM ( t ) = m 1 m 1  +  m 2 v 0 ( t  − t 0 ) + m 2 m 1  +  m 2 d. (6) The final crucial insight is to recognize that the center of mass position at  t  =  t 1  is position of the collision. Since the particles are colliding (and are small), both particles are at the same location, which also must be the center of mass. Thus, we have x 1 ( t 1 ) =  x 2 ( t 1 ) =  X CM ( t 1 ) . (7) Evaluating equation (6) at  t  =  t 1  and combining it with equations (1) and (7) gives the final answer X CM ( t 1 ) =  L  = m 1 m 1  +  m 2 v 0  ( t 1  − t 0 ) + m 2 m 1  +  m 2 d  =   m 1 v 0  ( t 1  − t 0 ) +  m 2 d m 1  +  m 2 . (8) Note that we never needed to use the form of the force between the objects. It was enough to know that there was no external force on the two particles and that they eventually collide. 4 Momentum, impulse, center of mass - Solutions to Problem Set 6 ',\n",

       "  'answer': '1. We start by applying Newton’s second law to the ball in the  ˆ x  direction. The only force is drag, so − βv x  =  ma x .

       "  'answer': 'We start by defining our system to include both the acrobat and the clown. The first important observation is that there is a collision between the acrobat and the clown. This collision is completely “inelastic” in that the two bodies collide and stick together after the collision. The details of the collision are determined by the internal forces in the system. Since this is a one-dimensional motion, we will use a coordinate system with the origin at the trampoline and  ˆ y  defined to be upwards. There are two important states to identify in this problem. State 1 is immediately before the collision, at a time that we’ll call  t 1 . At this moment, acrobat has just arrived at the platform of the clown, so both are at the same position y A ( t 1 ) =  y C ( t 1 ) =  h 0 , (1) where  y A ( t )  and  y C ( t )  are the vertical positions of the acrobat and clown respectively. Additionally, just before grabbing the clown the acrobat has a velocity of  ⃗ v A ( t 1 ) =  v A ( t 1 )ˆ y . The collision lasts a time  ∆ t coll . During this time interval, the acrobat grabs the clown. State 2 is immediately after the collision, at a time  t 2 . After the collision, the two people rise together with the same velocity  ⃗ v A ( t ) =  ⃗ v C ( t ) =  v AC ( t )ˆ y . The key assumption is that the time over which the collision occurs is very short  ∆ t coll  =  t 2  − t 1  ≈ 0 . Because the collision is so fast, the impulse delivered by the external gravitational force during the collision is negligibly small. This is the impulse approximation. Because of the impulse approximation, we can say that the total momentum of the system is constant during the collision. If the collision lasts a significant length of time, there would be some slowing down of the acrobat during the collision and we would have to calculate the effect of this. However, by assuming the collision is instantaneous, we can ignore this slowing down and consider the momentum of the system to be conserved. Now let us analyze the time intervals separated by the two states.  Before state 1 , the acrobat is undergoing projectile motion. From one-dimensional kinematics, the vertical component of the position and velocity of 1 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - Solutions to Problem Set 7 the acrobat is given by y A ( t ) =  − g 2 t 2  +  v A 0 t  +  y A 0  =  − g 2 t 2  +  v 0 t (2) v A ( t ) =  − gt  +  v A 0  =  − gt  +  v 0 (3) respectively, where  y A 0  = 0  and  v A 0  =  v 0  are the initial position and velocity of the acrobat as given in the problem. At  t  =  t 1  the acrobat is at height  y ( t 1 ) =  h 0 , so we know y A ( t 1 ) =  h 0  =  − g 2 t 2 1   +  v 0 t 1 . (4) Applying the quadratic formula, we find t 1  =   − v 0  ± p v 2 0   − 4( − g/ 2)( − h 0 ) 2( − g/ 2) =   v 0  ∓ p v 2 0   − 2 gh 0 g . (5) Substituting this into equation (3) evaluated at  t  =  t 1  allows us to find the velocity immediately before the collision v A ( t 1 ) =  ± q v 2 0   − 2 gh 0  = q v 2 0   − 2 gh 0 , (6) where we have taken the plus sign as we know the physical velocity must be positive. Between states 1 and 2 , we know from the impulse approximation that momentum is conserved ⃗ p sys ( t 1 ) =  ⃗ p sys ( t 2 ) . (7) Immediately before the collision, the momentum of the acrobat-clown system is only due to acrobat ⃗ p sys ( t 1 ) =  ⃗ p A ( t 1 ) +  ⃗ p C ( t 1 ) =  ⃗ p A ( t 1 ) =  m A v A ( t 1 )ˆ y  =  m A q v 2 0   − 2 gh 0 ˆ y, (8) where we have used equation (6). Immediately after the collision, the acrobat and clown are moving together, so the total momentum of the system is ⃗ p sys ( t 2 ) = ( m A  +  m C ) v AC ( t 2 )ˆ y. (9) Enforcing conservation of momentum (i.e. substituting equations (8) and (9) into equation (7)) allows us to find the velocity of the acrobat and clown immediately after the collision m A q v 2 0   − 2 gh 0 ˆ y  = ( m A  +  m C ) v AC ( t 2 )ˆ y ⇒ v AC ( t 2 ) = m A m A  +  m C q v 2 0   − 2 gh 0 .

Thus, their position and velocity is given by y AC ( t ) =  − g 2 ( t  − t 2 ) 2  +  v AC 0 ( t  − t 2 ) +  y AC 0 (11) v AC ( t ) =  − g ( t  − t 2 ) +  v AC 0 (12) respectively, where we have offset time such that  y AC 0  =  y AC ( t 2 )  and  v AC 0  =  v AC ( t 2 )  are the position and velocity of the acrobat at  t  =  t 2 . Just after the collision, the acrobat and clown are still at the level of the platform so  y AC 0  =  y AC ( t 2 ) =  h 0 . Substituting this and equation (10) into equations (11) and (12) gives y AC ( t ) =  − g 2 ( t  − t 2 ) 2  + m A m A  +  m C q v 2 0   − 2 gh 0 ( t  − t 2 ) +  h 0 (13) v AC ( t ) =  − g ( t  − t 2 ) + m A m A  +  m C q v 2 0   − 2 gh 0 .

       " {'question': 'A raindrop of initial mass  m 0  starts from rest and falls under the influence of gravity. Assume that as the raindrop travels through a stationary cloud, it gains mass at a rate proportional to the momentum of the raindrop, dm r dt =  km r v r , where  m r  is the instantaneous mass of the raindrop,  v r  is the instantaneous velocity of the raindrop, and  k is a constant with units of m -1 . You may neglect air resistance. 1. Derive a differential equation for the raindrop’s acceleration  dv r /dt  in terms of  k ,  v r , and the acceler- ation due to gravity  g . 2. What is the terminal speed  v r ∞ of the raindrop? Express your answer in terms of  k  and  g . 1 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - Problem Set 7 ',\n",
       "  'answer': '1. We start by choosing a coordinate system such that the  ˆ y  direction points downwards in the direction of the acceleration due to gravity. Note that the problem is one dimensional. Next, at an arbitrary time  t , we consider a system that is composed of the raindrop of instantaneous mass  m r  and a small differential mass element  ∆ m c  from the cloud. The raindrop is moving downwards at an instantaneous velocity  v r , while the differential mass element is at rest (since the cloud is stationary). Thus, we can draw the momentum diagram shown below at time  t . A very short time later at  t +∆ t , the differential mass element from the cloud has been incorporated into the raindrop. This slightly changes the mass of the raindrop to  m r  + ∆ m r  as well as the velocity to  v r  + ∆ v r . This is reflected in the momentum diagram shown below at time  t  + ∆ t . m r Δ m c v r m r  + Δ m r v r  + Δ v r time  t time  t  + Δ t g y From the momentum diagrams, we can use conservation of mass in the system to see that m r  + ∆ m c  =  m r  + ∆ m r ⇒ ∆ m c  = ∆ m r , (1) though this will not actually be needed to solve this problem. Additionally, we see that the total momentum of the system at time  t  is ⃗ p sys ( t ) =  m r v r ˆ y  + ∆ m c (0) =  m r v r ˆ y, (2) while at time  t  + ∆ t  it is ⃗ p sys ( t  + ∆ t ) = ( m r  + ∆ m r )( v r  + ∆ v r )ˆ y. (3) We can now write down the generalized form of Newton’s second law and use the limit form of the time derivative according to ⃗ F   ext net   =  d⃗ p sys dt = lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ ⃗ p sys ∆ t = lim ∆ t → 0 ⃗ p sys ( t  + ∆ t )  − ⃗ p sys ( t ) ∆ t . (4) 3 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - Solutions to Problem Set 7 If we drew a free body diagram, we’d see that the only external force on the system is gravity  m r g ˆ y . Using this and substituting equations (2) and (3) into equation (4), we find m r g  = lim ∆ t → 0 ( m r  + ∆ m r )( v r  + ∆ v r )  − m r v r ∆ t = lim ∆ t → 0 m r ∆ v r  + ∆ m r v r  + ∆ m r ∆ v r ∆ t (5) in the  ˆ y  direction. We can neglect the final term  ∆ m r ∆ v r  in this expression as it is product of two differential elements. Since the differential elements are infinitesimally small, a product of two differential elements will be much smaller than terms that include just one differential element (e.g. ∆ m r ∆ v r  ≪ m r ∆ v r ). Thus, equation (5) becomes m r g  =  m r \\x12 lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ v r ∆ t \\x13 + \\x12 lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ m r ∆ t \\x13 v r . (6) Converting the limits back into derivatives, we find the differential equation m r g  =  m r dv r dt   +  dm r dt  v r . (7) As an aside, note that this is equivalent to the standard generalized Newton’s second law applied to the raindrop alone (i.e.  F   ext net   =  dp r /dt  =  d ( m r v r ) /dt  = ( dm r /dt ) v r   +  m r ( dv r /dt )  using the product rule). This holds because the physical situation corresponds to a category 1 case (as defined in lecture 7a), in which the differential mass element carries no momentum. If the differential element did carry momentum (e.g. problem 4 below), the situation becomes more complicated and using the generalized Newton’s second law for the raindrop alone would no longer be accurate. To find an equation for  v r ( t ) , we can substitute the rate of mass gain from the problem statement into equation (7), dm r dt =  km r v r , (8) which fortunately causes all the factors of  m r  to cancel and gives g  =   dv r dt   +  kv 2 r . (9) This is the differential equation the problem asked for. 2. To calculate the terminal velocity  v ∞ of the raindrop, we could solve the differential equation and then take the limit at  t  →∞ . However, there is a much easier way. We know that the raindrop will reach terminal velocity only when its acceleration  dv r /dt  = 0  becomes zero. Otherwise the velocity would still be changing with time, so it wouldn’t be “terminal”. Thus, we can use this fact to write equation (9) as g  = 0 +  kv 2 r ∞ (10) and find that v r ∞ = r g k  .

       " {'question': 'A uniform chain of mass  M  and length  L  is suspended vertically with its lowest end touching a scale. The chain is released and falls onto the scale. What is the force measured by the scale when a length of chain D  has fallen? Assume that the individual links of the chain are infinitesimally small and let  g  denote the acceleration due to gravity. ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'This problem is challenging. We start by taking a coordinate system with  ˆ y  pointing downwards in the direction of the acceleration due to gravity and note that the problem is one dimensional. We will let  t  = 0 be the moment that the chain is dropped. Next, we can divide up the chain into many differential elements, each of length  ∆ y . Then, we will consider the differential element that starts a distance  D  above the scale 4 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - Solutions to Problem Set 7 and define its initial position as the origin of our coordinate system. You can’t push with a chain, so there is no force from the ground that is transmitted up the chain to the differential elements still in the air. In other words, each differential element of the chain is in free fall and governed by projectile motion until it makes contact with the scale. Thus, given our coordinate system and the fact that the chain starts at rest, the position and velocity of the differential element follows ⃗ r ( t ) =  y ( t )ˆ y  =  1 2 gt 2 ˆ y (1) ⃗ v ( t ) =  v y ( t )ˆ y  =  gt ˆ y (2) respectively. Using equation (1), we can calculate the time  t  just before the differential element of interest makes contact with the scale to be y ( t ) =  D  =  1 2 gt 2 ⇒ t  = s 2 D g  . (3) Substituting this into equation (2), we see that the element is traveling with a velocity of ⃗ v ( t ) =  v y ( t )ˆ y  =  g s 2 D g   ˆ y  = p 2 gD ˆ y (4) just before it impacts the scale. A very short time later  t  + ∆ t , the differential element is at rest on the scale. We can calculate the force required to cause this through the change in momentum of the differential element. First, we need the mass ∆ m . We have choosen to divide up the rope into differential elements of length  ∆ y . Thus, given that the linear mass density  λ  of the chain is uniform, we can find the mass according to λ  =   M L   = ∆ m ∆ y ⇒ ∆ m  =   M L   ∆ y. (5) We can now define a system composed of exclusively the differential element of interest and draw momentum diagrams at time  t  and  t  + ∆ t  (see below). Using equations (4) and (5), the momentum of such a system at time  t  is ⃗ p sys ( t ) = ∆ m⃗ v ( t ) = \\x12 M L   ∆ y \\x13 \\x10p 2 gD ˆ y \\x11 = p 2 gD M L   ∆ y ˆ y, (6) while at  t  + ∆ t  the total momentum is ⃗ p sys ( t  + ∆ t ) = ∆ m (0) = 0 .

(8) 5 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - Solutions to Problem Set 7 The external force will be only the normal force from the scale on the differential element ⃗ F   ext net   =  − F scale ˆ y, (9) which is what we are interested in calculating to determine the reading on the scale. This is because the gravitational force can be neglected through the impulse approximation, since the time interval  ∆ t  is so short. Substituting equations (6), (7) and (9) into equation (8), we find − F scale  = lim ∆ t → 0 0  − √ 2 gD ( M/L )∆ y ∆ t =  − p 2 gD M L \\x12 lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ y ∆ t \\x13 (10) in the  ˆ y  direction. Converting the limit back into a derivative gives F scale  = p 2 gD M L dy dt  . (11) Using the definition of velocity as the derivative of position  v y  =  dy/dt  and making use of equation (4) gives F scale  = p 2 gD M L  v y  = p 2 gD M L \\x10p 2 gD \\x11 = 2 gD M L  , (12) the magnitude of the upwards force exerted by the scale on the differential element of the chain. If we drew a free body diagram for the scale at time  t  + ∆ t , we would see that there are two forces from the chain acting on it: the normal force from the differential element that just impacted the scale and the normal force from the part of the chain that is already sitting stationary on the scale. The length of chain already on the scale is  D , so we can use the linear density to find its mass to be  m  =  λD  =  D ( M/L ) . Thus, the part of the chain sitting on the scale exerts a downward force with a magnitude of  mg  =  D ( M/L ) g . Adding this to the action-reaction pair of equation (12) gives a total downwards force of the chain on the scale of Scale reading  =  D M L  g  + 2 gDM L   = 3 gDM L  . (13) This is our final answer for the reading on the scale. Note that since  D  was an arbitrary location, we can use equation (3) to replace  D  in equation (13) with  t . This allows us to see how the scale reading depends on time Scale reading  =  3 2 M L  g 2 t 2 . (14) Thus, the scale reading increases quadratically with time. The top end of the chain will land on the scale when  D  =  L , at which time equation (13) becomes Scale reading  = 3 Mg. (15) In other words, the maximum reading of the scale is three times the mass of the rope. Of course, after the entire chain has come to rest, the reading on the scale will drop to the weight of the chain, i.e. Scale reading  =  Mg. (16) ',\n",

       "  'answer': 'We start by choosing a coordinate system such that  y  = 0  is the ground and the  ˆ y  direction points upwards in the opposite direction of the acceleration due to gravity. Note that the problem is one dimensional. Next, 6 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - Solutions to Problem Set 7 at an arbitrary time  t , we consider a system that is composed of the rocket including  all  the fuel it currently contains, which we will denote as having a total instantaneous mass  m r . The instantaneous speed of the rocket is  v r , so we can draw the momentum diagram shown below at time  t . A very short time later at t  + ∆ t , the rocket has ejected a differential mass element  ∆ m f  of fuel, which slightly alters the mass of the rocket to  m r  + ∆ m r . Note that it is important allow an arbitrary change in the rocket’s mass by  +∆ m r . This will help to prevent sign errors later in the derivation (e.g. accidentally accounting for the fact that the rocket’s mass is decreasing twice) and accommodate more general calculations where the mass is changing due to several mechanisms. After ejecting the differential mass element, the velocity of the rocket is also slightly changed to be  v r  + ∆ v r . We must also include the momentum of the ejected fuel as it is still part of the system. It has a mass of  ∆ m f  and a velocity of  − u ˆ y  relative to the rocket . This means that it has a velocity of  ( v r  − u )ˆ y  in the inertial laboratory frame. We have drawn the momentum diagram at time  t  + ∆ t below. time  t time  t  + Δ t g m r v r v r  + Δ v r Δ m f m r  + Δ m r v r  − u y From the momentum diagram, we can use conservation of mass in the system to see that m r  =  m r  + ∆ m r  + ∆ m f ⇒ ∆ m f  =  − ∆ m r . (1) Additionally, we see that the total momentum of the system at time  t  is ⃗ p sys ( t ) =  m r v r ˆ y, (2) while at time  t  + ∆ t  it is ⃗ p sys ( t  + ∆ t ) = ( m r  + ∆ m r )( v r  + ∆ v r )ˆ y  + ∆ m f ( v r  − u )ˆ y  = ( m r  + ∆ m r )( v r  + ∆ v r )ˆ y  − ∆ m r ( v r  − u )ˆ y,  (3) making use of equation (1). We can now write down the generalized form of Newton’s second law and use the limit form of the time derivative according to ⃗ F   ext net   =  d⃗ p sys dt = lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ ⃗ p sys ∆ t = lim ∆ t → 0 ⃗ p sys ( t  + ∆ t )  − ⃗ p sys ( t ) ∆ t . (4) If we drew a free body diagram, we’d see that the only external force on the system is gravity   ⃗ F   ext net   =  − m r g ˆ y . Using this and substituting equations (2) and (3) into equation (4), we find − m r g  = lim ∆ t → 0 ( m r  + ∆ m r )( v r  + ∆ v r )  − ∆ m r ( v r  − u )  − m r v r ∆ t = lim ∆ t → 0 m r ∆ v r  + ∆ m r ∆ v r  + ∆ m r u ∆ t (5) in the  ˆ y  direction. We can neglect the  ∆ m r ∆ v r  term in this expression as it is product of two differential elements. Since the differential elements are infinitesimally small, a product of two differential elements will be much smaller than terms that include just one differential element (e.g.  ∆ m r ∆ v r  ≪ m r ∆ v r ). Thus, equation (5) becomes − m r g  =  m r  lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ v r ∆ t   + lim ∆ t → 0 ∆ m r ∆ t  u. (6) 7 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - Solutions to Problem Set 7 Converting the limits back into derivatives, we find the differential equation − m r g  =  m r dv r dt   +  dm r dt  u. (7) Now, as in problem 2, we must determine  dm r /dt , the rate of change of the mass of the rocket (including the fuel it contains). We know that, at take-off when  t  = 0 , the total mass of the rocket and fuel is  M . Additionally, it ejects fuel at a constant rate of  D . Thus, the total mass of the rocket as a function of time is m r ( t ) =  M  − Dt, (8) which gives dm r dt =  − D (9) after taking a derivative. Substituting this result into equation (7) gives the differential equation − m r g  =  m r dv r dt   − Du. (10) Rearranging and using equation (8) gives dv r dt   =  − g  + Du M  − Dt . (11) The problem statement ultimately asks us to find the speed and altitude of the rocket. Thus, we will integrate equation (11) to find the velocity v r ( t ) =  − Z gdt  + Z Du M  − Dt dt. (12) The first integral is straightforward, but to accomplish the second we must perform a change of variables. We know the integral of  1 /x 1  is the natural logarithm, so we will let x 1  =  M  − Dt (13) and rewrite v r ( t ) =  − Z gdt  +  Du Z 1 x 1 dt dx 1 dx 1 . (14) Solving equation (13) for  t  =  M/D  − x 1 /D  and taking a derivative gives  dt/dx 1  =  − 1 /D . Substituting this, taking the integrals, and using equation (13) gives v r ( t ) =  − Z gdt  +  Du Z 1 x 1 \\x12 − 1 D \\x13 dx 1  =  − gt  − u  ln( x 1 ) +  C 1  =  − gt  − u  ln( M  − Dt ) +  C 1 , (15) where  C 1  is a constant of integration. It can be determined by using the initial condition that the rocket is at rest at  t  = 0 , i.e.  v r (0) = 0 . This gives v r (0) = 0 =  − u  ln( M ) +  C 1 ⇒ C 1  =  u  ln( M ) . (16) Substituting this into equation (15) and using the property of logarithms that  ln( A ) − ln( B ) = ln( A/B )  gives v r ( t ) =  − gt  − u  ln( M  − Dt ) +  u  ln( M ) =  − gt  − u  ln \\x12 M  − Dt M \\x13 .

We can use the second hint in the problem statement if we first perform a change of variables to x 2  =   M  − Dt M . (19) This allows us to write equation (18) as y r ( t ) =  − Z gtdt  − u Z ln ( x 2 )   dt dx 2 dx 2 . (20) Solving equation (19) for  t  =  − M/D ( x 2  − 1)  and taking a derivative gives  dt/dx 2  =  − M/D .

It can be determined by using the initial condition that the rocket starts on the ground at  t  = 0 , i.e.  y r (0) = 0 . This gives y r (0) = 0 =  u M D   (ln (1)  − 1) +  C 2 ⇒ C 2  =  − u M D   ( − 1) =  uM D  .

(24) Equations (17) and (24) are the speed and altitude as a function of time. To solve the problem, we are interested in their values at the time that the fuel is exhausted, which we’ll denote by  t f . We know that the total amount of fuel is  m t  and it is ejected at a rate of  D . Thus, the fuel will be completely used up at a time  t f  =  m t /D  after launch. Substituting this into equations (17) and (24) gives v r ( t f ) =  − g  m t D   − u  ln \\x12 M  − m t M \\x13 (25) y r ( t f ) =  − g 2 \\x10 m t D \\x11 2 +  u \\x14 M  − m t D \\x12 ln \\x12 M  − m t M \\x13 − 1 \\x13 +   M D \\x15 .

       "  'answer': 'nd   law: Tetherball In this scenario, we are being asked to check the work-kinetic energy theorem. To calculate the net work done on the body, we first need to identify the forces applied. We start by defining a cylindrical coordinate system with the origin located at the fixed ring in the center of the circular motion. We are told that the string is pulled downward with constant velocity, so the body moves inward with  ˙ ρ  =  − V  =  constant and ¨ ρ  = 0 . In order to calculate the work done by the string, we need to know the tension force and the trajectory of the ball.

       " {'question': 'At time  t  = 0 , a cannon in the middle of a flat desert fires a projectile of mass  M  with a speed  v 0  at an angle α  with respect to the horizontal. At the peak of its trajectory, the projectile explodes into a thousand pieces, which increases the kinetic energy of the system by  W . The masses of these fragments are not necessarily equal. However, they all have an identical (but unknown) speed  u  measured with respect to the projectile just before it exploded. Lastly, you know that the velocities of all the fragments immediately after the explosion are purely horizontal. Neglect air drag. 1. At what time does the explosion occur? At what time do the pieces hit the ground? Why do they all hit the ground at the same time? 2. The pieces land on the ground in a circle. Why? What is the distance between the center of the circle and the cannon? Calculate the speed  u  and then the radius of the circle. 3. Consider the case where one of the pieces hits the cannon. Calculate  W  in terms of the initial kinetic energy of the projectile. 1 Work and energy - Problem Set 8 ',\n",
       "  'answer': '1.  At what time does the explosion occur? We start by defining a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the cannon, a vertical axis  z pointing upwards, and a horizontal axis  x  such that it contains the horizontal component of  ⃗ v 0 . The projectile undergoes motion under a constant acceleration of  ⃗ g  =  − g ˆ z , so its vertical velocity and position are given by v z ( t ) =  − gt  +  v 0  sin  α (1) z ( t ) =  − g 2 t 2  +  v 0 t  sin  α (2) respectively, where we have used the initial conditions that  v z (0) =  v 0  sin  α  and  z (0) = 0 . The peak of the trajectory is reached when  v z ( t e ) = 0 , so we can use equation (1) to find the time of the explosion t e  to be v z ( t e ) = 0 =  − gt e  +  v 0  sin  α ⇒ t e  =   v 0  sin  α g . (3) At what time do the pieces hit the ground? From equations (2) and (3), we see that the vertical position of the projectile at the time of the explosion is z ( t e ) =  z e  =  − g 2 \\x12 v 0  sin  α g \\x13 2 +  v 0 \\x12 v 0  sin  α g \\x13 sin  α  =  ( v 0  sin  α ) 2 2 g . (4) At this time, the projectile explodes into a thousand pieces, which each still undergo projectile motion. Thus, their height evolves according to z ( t ) =  − g 2 ( t  − t e ) 2  +  z e (5) because their vertical velocity is  v z ( t e ) = 0  and their position is  z ( t e ) =  z e  at time  t  =  t e . From this we can calculate the time  t g  at which they hit the ground  z ( t g ) = 0  to be z ( t g ) = 0 =  − g 2 ( t g  − t e ) 2  +  z e ⇒ t g  =  t e  + r 2 z e g  . (6) 3 Work and energy - Solutions to Problem Set 8 Substituting equations (3) and (4) gives t g  =   v 0  sin  α g + s 2 g ( v 0  sin  α ) 2 2 g = 2 v 0  sin  α g . (7) This is a sensible result as the fragments all have zero vertical velocity just before and just after the explosion. Thus, it will take them the same amount of time to fall to the ground as it did for them to ascend. Thus, we’d expect  t g  = 2 t e , which we see is the case by comparing equations (3) and (7). Why do they all hit the ground at the same time? Just before the explosion, the projectile has a purely horizontal velocity (since it is at the peak of its trajectory). As a result of the explosion, the fragments don’t gain any vertical velocity because their velocity relative to the original projectile is purely horizontal. Thus, their velocities relative to the ground are also horizontal just after time  t e . This means that the pieces all have the same height and vertical velocity at  t e . Because gravity accelerates objects the same regardless of mass, they all hit the ground at the same time. 2.  The pieces land on the ground in a circle. Why? Given that we know the time at which the fragments hit the ground, in this part of the problem we will only consider the horizontal motion of the objects and ignore the vertical motion. It is not needed. First, we view the dynamics from the frame of reference moving with the horizontal location of the center of mass of the system (i.e. the projectile). In this frame, we will use cylindrical coordinates with the origin defined to be the ground directly below the location of the center of mass. Immediately after the explosion, all the pieces have the same speed  u  with respect to the origin of our moving frame and are moving purely horizontally. This means their velocity is entirely in the outwards radial direction. In this direction, they experience no acceleration, so their horizontal velocity and position are given by v ρ ( t ) =  u (8) ρ ( t ) =  u ( t  − t e ) (9) for any time  t > t e . Here we used the fact that at  t  =  t e  the horizontal position of every piece is at the origin and the initial velocity is  u . Thus, after a time interval  t  − t e  the pieces lie on a circle with radius  u ( t  − t e )  centered around the origin of the moving center of mass frame. To see what shape they make when they land on the ground, we need to convert to the stationary frame of the ground. To do so, we use equations (8) and (9) and the formulas to convert between references frames to write ⃗ v i ( t ) =   ⃗ V CM ( t ) +  u ˆ r i (10) ⃗ r i ( t ) =   ⃗ R CM ( t ) +  u ( t  − t e )ˆ r i , (11) where  ⃗ v i ( t )  and  ⃗ r i ( t )  are the horizontal velocity and position of the  i th   fragment in the ground reference frame,   ⃗ V CM ( t )  and   ⃗ R CM ( t )  are the horizontal velocity and position of the origin of the center of mass frame, and  ˆ r i  is the radial unit vector pointing at the  i th   fragment from the origin of the center of mass frame. Due to the fact that there is no net external horizontal force on the system, the horizontal momentum of the projectile does not change. Thus,   ⃗ V CM ( t )  is a constant and equal to its initial value when the projectile is launched   ⃗ V CM ( t ) =  v 0  cos  α ˆ x . This implies that the center of mass position is   ⃗ R CM ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  α ˆ x  because the center of mass position at  t  = 0  is at the origin in the ground reference frame (i.e. the integration constant that arises in going from velocity to position is zero). Plugging this result into equation (11), we see that ⃗ r i ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  α ˆ x  +  u ( t  − t e )ˆ r i (12) 4 Work and energy - Solutions to Problem Set 8 at any time  t > t e . The last term tell us that, in the center of mass reference frame, all the pieces are flying apart outwards from each other with the same speed  u , but in different directions  ˆ r i . Thus, they form a circle of radius R ( t ) =  u ( t  − t e ) . (13) The first term on the right side of equation (12) tells us how this motion changes when we convert to the reference frame of the ground. Since the subscript  i  doesn’t appear, we know that this term is the same for all fragments. Specifically, all fragments are moving together in the  ˆ x  direction with time. This corresponds to a displacement in the center of the circle by ⃗ d ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  α ˆ x. (14) However, since all pieces are moving together, it doesn’t change the shape from being circular. In conclusion, in the reference frame of the ground the pieces form a circle that shifts in the  ˆ x  direction with time. What is the distance between the center of the circle and the cannon? This can be found by taking the magnitude of equation (14) at the time when the fragments hit the ground  t  =  t g  using equation (7), giving d ( t g ) = 2 v 2 0 g   sin  α  cos  α. (15) This is the same location that the projectile would have hit had it not exploded. Calculate the speed  u  and then the radius of the circle. To calculate  u  it is most convienant to return the reference frame moving with the horizontal location of the center of mass of the system. Just before the explosion the total kinetic energy of the system is zero as there is no vertical motion and we are in a reference frame moving with the horizontal motion of the projectile. From the problem statement, we know that just after the explosion the kinetic energy of the system increases by  W . This must be contained in the speed  u  possessed by each of the 1000 fragments. Using this we can calculate  u  to be W  = 1000 X i =1 K i  = 1000 X i =1 1 2 m i u 2  = 1 2 u 2 1000 X i =1 m i  =  1 2 u 2 M ⇒ u  = r 2 W M  . (16) To find the radius of the circle we evaluate equation (13) at the time when the fragments hit the ground t  =  t g  and substitute equations (3), (7), and (16). This gives R ( t g ) = r 2 W M v 0 g   sin  α. (17) 3. If a fragment hits the cannon, then we know the radius of the circle must be equal to the distance between the cannon and the center of the circle at  t  =  t g , R ( t g ) =  d ( t g ) . (18) Substituting equations (15) and (17) gives r 2 W M v 0 g   sin  α  = 2 v 2 0 g   sin  α  cos  α ⇒ W  = 2 Mv 2 0   cos 2  α ⇒ W  = 4 K 0  cos 2   α (19) as the initial kinetic energy of the projectile is  K 0  =  Mv 2 0 / 2 . 5 Work and energy - Solutions to Problem Set 8 ',\n",

       "  'answer': 'This problem may seem complicated at first (all those parameters!), but the work-kinetic energy theorem makes it tractable, even simple. The work-kinetic energy theorem tells us that the work done by the net force on the object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. So let’s take the initial state to be when the spring is compressed by a distance  x 0  and the final state to be when the object is at its maximum height. In both of these states, the velocity is equal to zero, so the kinetic energy is zero as well. Thus, as a consequence of the work-kinetic energy theorem, we know that the total work done on the object during its path must be equal to zero. We choose the positive  ˆ x  direction to point to the left since it is the direction of motion. The motion has four stages and we need to calculate the work on the object during each: 1. Using the form of the spring force, we can calculate the work done by the spring to be W spring  = Z  0 − x 0 F spring dx  = Z  0 − x 0 ( − kx ) dx  =  1 2 kx 2 0 . (1) 2. Using the form of the friction force, we can calculate the work done by the horizontal track to be W fric  = Z  d 0 F fric dx  =  − Z  d 0 ( mgµ ( x )) dx  =  − mg Z  d 0 µ 0  +  µ 1 \\x10 x d \\x11 dx  =  − mgd \\x10 µ 0  +   µ 1 2 \\x11 . (2) 3. The work done by the normal force of the surface of the loop is zero because the normal force is always perpendicular to the surface and the object is always moving along the surface. Thus, the normal force is perpendicular to the trajectory, so the dot product of the force and the displacement is zero. 4. Using the form of the gravitational force, we can calculate the work done by gravity as the object moves to a height  h  to be W grav  =  − Z  h 0 F grav dy  =  − Z  h 0 ( mg ) dy  =  − mgh. (3) The total work done on the object is the sum of all these contributions, which must be equal to zero by the work-kinetic energy theorem.

       "  'answer': 'θ mg F f N x y 1. First, we take a coordinate system with the  ˆ x  and  ˆ y  unit vectors defined as shown in the figure above. In the  ˆ x  and  ˆ y  directions, Newton’s second law is mg  sin  θ  − F f  =  ma x (1) N  − mg  cos  θ  =  ma y  = 0 ⇒ N  =  mg  cos  θ (2) respectively, where  F f  is the magnitude of the kinetic friction force,  N  is the magnitude of the normal force, and we know that there is no acceleration in the  ˆ y  direction. Using the form of the friction force and equation (2), we find F f  =  µ k N  =  µ k mg  cos  θ. (3) This allows us to calculate the total work done by friction to be W f  = Z  d 0 ⃗ F f  ·  ˆ xdx  =  − Z  d 0 F f dx  =  − F f d  =  − µ k mgd  cos  θ.

In this part, we will calculate the total work performed on the child and then use the work-kinetic energy theorem to determine the kinetic energy, which allows us to find the final speed. We already know the work done by friction from part 1. The only other force in the problem is gravity, for which we can calculate the work as W g  = Z  0 h 0 ⃗ F g  ·  ˆ ydy  = Z  0 h 0 ( − mg ˆ y )  ·  ˆ ydy  = Z  h 0 0 mg ˆ y  ·  ˆ ydy  =  mg ( h 0  − 0) =  mg ( d  sin  θ ) =  mgd  sin  θ,  (6) where we have adopted a new coordinate system with  ˆ y  pointing straight upwards and note that the child is traveling  from  a height  h 0  to  a height  0 . We also used trigonometry to calculate the height of the slide  h 0  =  d  sin  θ  in terms of known quantities. Thus, the total work performed on the child is W  =  W f  +  W g  =  − µ k mgd  cos  θ  +  mgd  sin  θ. (7) By the work-kinetic energy theorem, this work must be equal to the change in kinetic energy according to W  = ∆ K  =  K f  − K i .

(9) 7 Work and energy - Solutions to Problem Set 8 At the bottom, they are moving at some speed  v f  (which we want to calculate), so K f  =  1 2 mv 2 f .

(11) We can solve this to find that the speed of the child at the bottom of the slide is v f  = p 2 gd  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ ) .

To calculate the time it takes for the child to slide down the slide, we use Newton’s second law in the ˆ x  direction (in the coordinate system of part 1). Substituting equation (3) into equation (1) gives a x ( t ) =  g  sin  θ  − µ k g  cos  θ  =  g  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ )  . (14) Integrating this once in time yields the velocity v x ( t ) =  gt  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ )  , (15) where the integration constant is zero because the child starts at rest. Since we know the final speed from part 2, we can use it to calculate the final time  t f  as v x ( t f ) =  v f  =  gt f  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ ) ⇒ t f  = v f g  (sin  θ  − µ k  cos  θ ) .

Since we can assume that the children start and finish at rest, by the work-kinetic energy theorem we know that the total work must be zero. As a child ascends, it experiences two forces. The normal force from the ladder, which the child uses to push itself up, and the gravitational force, which is pulling downwards on the child. Thus, we have W  =  W g  +  W N  = ∆ K  = 0 , (19) where we note that  W N  represents the work done by the child via the normal force. Defining a coordinate system with the origin at the ground and the  ˆ y  direction pointing upwards, we see that the work done by gravity as the child ascends is W g  = Z  h 0 0 ⃗ F g  ·  ˆ ydy  = Z  h 0 0 ( − mg ˆ y )  ·  ˆ ydy  =  − mgh 0 . (20) Substituting this into equation (19) allows us to calculate the work done by the child W N  =  mgh 0 . (21) We see that this doesn’t depend on time, only on the mass of the child. Since the two children have equal masses, they do the same amount of work. 8 ',\n",

       "  'answer': '1. As the block is initially at rest  v 0  = 0 , the initial kinetic energy before the latch is released is  K 0  = mv 2 0 / 2 = 0 . The initial potential energy of the compression of the spring is given by  U s 0   =  kx 2 / 2 . We will define the origin of our coordinate system to be at the height of the horizontal track, so the initial height of the block is  y 0  = 0  and the initial gravitational potential energy is  U g 0  =  mgy 0  = 0 . Therefore, the total initial energy is E 0  =  K 0  +  U s 0  +  U g 0  = 0 +   k 2 x 2  + 0 =  k 2 x 2 . (1) At the top of the loop  y t  = 2 R , the kinetic energy is  K t  =  mv 2 t   / 2 , the gravitational potential energy is  U gt  =  mgy t  = 2 mgR , and the spring is no longer in contact with the block so  U st  = 0 . Thus, the total energy at the top of the loop is given by E t  =  K t  +  U st  +  U gt  =   m 2   v 2 t   + 0 + 2 mgR  =  m 2   v 2 t   + 2 mgR. (2) Since the track is frictionless and there is no air drag, mechanical energy is conserved and we can use equations (1) and (2) to write E 0  =  E t ⇒ k 2 x 2  =  m 2   v 2 t   + 2 mgR ⇒ K t  =   m 2   v 2 t   =  k 2 x 2  − 2 mgR.

       "  'answer': '1.

(2) 3. To find the speed  v 0  at  x  = 0 , we can use conservation of mechanical energy between any two points x 1  and  x 2  according to E ( x 1 ) =  E ( x 2 ) ⇒ K ( x 1 ) +  U ( x 1 ) =  K ( x 2 ) +  U ( x 2 ) . (3) Obviously we want to take one of the points to be the origin  x 1  = 0  as it is where we want to find the speed. At this location the kinetic energy is related to the speed by  K ( x 1 ) =  K (0) =  mv 2 0 / 2 . However, the second point requires more thought. It is best to choose one of the turning points because we know that the velocity is zero as the particle is reversing its direction. Thus, at  x 2  =  a  the kinetic energy is K ( x 2 ) =  K ( a ) = 0 . Plugging in these facts and the form of  U ( x )  into equation (3) yields m 2   v 2 0   − U 0 e − 0 2 /a 2  = 0  − U 0 e − a 2 /a 2 ⇒ m 2   v 2 0   − U 0   =  − U 0 e − 1 .

       " {'question': 'An object of mass  m  is released from rest at a height  h  above the surface of a table. The object slides along the inside of a loop-the-loop track, consisting of a ramp and a circular loop of radius  R  (as shown in the figure). If the mass is just barely able to complete the loop without ever losing contact with the track, what height  h  did the object start at? Assume that the track is frictionless and neglect air resistance. ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'This problem is similar to problem 1. As the block is initially at rest  v 0  = 0 , the initial kinetic energy is K 0  =  mv 2 0 / 2 = 0 . The initial potential energy is due to gravity. We will define the reference point to be at the height of the table, so the initial height of the object is  y 0  =  h  and the initial gravitational potential energy is  U g 0  =  mgh . Therefore, the total initial energy is E 0  =  K 0  +  U g 0  = 0 +  mgh  =  mgh. (1) At the top of the loop  y t  = 2 R , the kinetic energy is  K t  =  mv 2 t   / 2  and the gravitational potential energy is U gt  =  mgy t  = 2 mgR . Thus, the total energy at the top of the loop is given by E t  =  K t  +  U gt  =   m 2   v 2 t   + 2 mgR. (2) Since the track is frictionless and there is no air drag, there is no non-conservative force and mechanical energy is conserved. We can use equations (1) and (2) to write E 0  =  E t ⇒ mgh  =   m 2   v 2 t   + 2 mgR. (3) y From the properties of circular motion, we know that the acceleration in the radial direction is equal to the centripetal acceleration  a cent  =  − v 2 t   /R . Thus, at the top of the loop (shown in figure above) Newton’s second law in the  ˆ y  direction is − mg  − N  =  − mv 2 t R  . (4) From the information given in the problem statement, we know that the mass just barely doesn’t lose contact with the track. Thus, the normal force of the track on the mass must be effectively  N  = 0 , so equation (4) becomes mg  =   mv 2 t R ⇒ v t  = p gR.

The opposite end of the rope is pulled horizontally with a force   ⃗ F a . The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and table is  µ k , while friction between the rope and table can be neglected. Find the tension in the rope as a function of the distance from the block. L M F a x y m b 2 ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'There are several methods to solve this problem. Below we show two of them. 1. In method 1, we will use differential elements. To calculate the tension, we start by considering a small piece of rope with length  ∆ x  and its left end located at an arbitrary position  x  along the rope. Here we define a coordinate system where  x  = 0  is the location at which the rope connects to the block and ˆ x  points to the right. Since the rope has a uniform linear mass density  λ , we can calculate the mass of the differential element  ∆ m  to be λ  =   M L   = ∆ m ∆ x ⇒ ∆ m  =   M L   ∆ x. (1) Drawing a free body diagram for the piece of rope, we see that Newton’s second law in the  ˆ x  direction is given by T ( x  + ∆ x )  − T ( x ) = ∆ ma r , (2) where  a r  is the acceleration of the piece of rope. Substituting equation (1) and rearranging gives T ( x  + ∆ x )  − T ( x ) = \\x12 M L   ∆ x \\x13 a r ⇒ T ( x  + ∆ x )  − T ( x ) ∆ x =   M L  a r . (3) Taking the limit that the differential element is infinitesimally small  ∆ x  → 0  produces the differential equation dT dx   =  M L  a r . (4) Importantly, since the rope does not stretch, we know that the entire rope must move together. This implies that all the different pieces of the rope accelerate together. In other words,  a r  =  a  does not vary with  x  location. This can be seen as a constraint condition. Thus, we can directly integrate equation (4) to find T ( x ) =   M L  ax  +  C, (5) where  C  is an integration constant. To find the value of  C  we must apply a boundary condition. We can  either  use  T ( L ) =  F a  or find a condition on  T (0)  by analyzing the block. The first is quicker and allows us to directly calculate T ( L ) =  F a  =   M L  aL  +  C ⇒ C  =  F a  − Ma (6) from equation (5). The second is more work. We draw a free body diagram for the block and see that Newton’s second law in the  ˆ x  direction is F rb  − F f  =  m b a, (7) where  F rb  is the force of the rope on the block and we know that the block must have the same acceleration  a  as the rope. To calculate the kinetic friction force  F f  =  µ k N , we must know the normal force  N . This can be found from the  ˆ y  component of Newton’s second law for the block to be N  − m b g  = 0 ⇒ N  =  m b g (8) since the block has no acceleration in the vertical direction. Thus, the kinetic friction force is given by F f  =  µ k m b g.

The roll of paper is free to rotate around a massless internal plastic cylinder of radius  r . This plastic cylinder is suspended from the wall by two metal rods, which both make an angle  θ  with the wall. While you may ignore the friction between the internal plastic cylinder and the paper roll, the friction at the point of contact  C  between the roll and the wall is  not  negligible. It is characterized by a coefficient of static friction  µ s  and a coefficient of kinetic friction  µ c , which satisfy 1 2 tan  θ  > µ s  > µ c . We will model someone pulling on the toilet paper as applying a known constant vertical force   ⃗ F a  =  F a ˆ j at the outer edge of the roll (i.e. point  A ). The roll starts off at rest. We will assume that the paper is sufficiently thin that the radius  R , mass  M , and moment of inertia  I G  remain constant as it is unrolled vertically to dispense several squares of toilet paper.

The purpose was to evaluate this as a method of planetary defense (i.e. to prevent future asteroids from hitting Earth). We are going to study some aspects of this mission. The system chosen for the DART mission is a double asteroid. It is composed of a main object Didymos (called D1) and a second smaller object Dimorphos (called D2). D1 has a spherical shape, a radius of  r 1 , and an unknown mass  m 1 . D2 has a spherical shape, a radius of  r 2 , and an unknown mass  m 2 . D2 orbits around D1 in a circular trajectory with a radius of  R 0  and a period of  T 0 . The quantities  r 1 ,  r 2 ,  R 0 , and  T 0  are all known values (as they have been measured from Earth by radar), but  m 1  and  m 2  are initially unknown. We know the value of the universal gravitational constant  G and will perform most of the calculations in the reference frame of D1 (i.e. the origin  O  is at the center of D1) given the cylindrical coordinate system shown in the figure below. You may assume that all of the objects in this problem have only translational motion (i.e. they do not rotate about their center of mass). a.

       "  'answer': 'a. This problem is simpler than it initially appears. We know both the radius  R 0  and the period  T 0  of the circular orbit that D2 is executing about D1. Thus, D2 travels once around D1 in a time  T 0  and travels a total distance of  2 πR 0 . This means its average speed is v 0  =  2 πR 0 T 0 . (1) Since there are no other forces in the problem, D2 must be executing uniform circular motion, so its average speed is identical to its instantaneous speed v 0  =  2 πR 0 T 0 . (2) Since the problem asks for the  velocity , so we must determine the direction as well. From the diagram in the problem statement, we see that D2 moves purely in the   ˆ ϕ  direction so ⃗ v 0  =  2 πR 0 T 0 ˆ ϕ. (3) ',\n",

Since we are interested in properties of the ball at different positions (as opposed to different times), we guess that conservation of energy will be the quicker strategy. Since the only force acting on the ball is gravity, which is a conservative force, mechanical energy is conserved.

Note that in this part you may assume the  tension is zero at the end of the rope  and include the variables  ρ ,  ϕ , and  ω  in your answer. To calculate the tension in a massive rope, we start by dividing it into differential elements and then draw the free body diagram for an arbitrary element in the middle (shown above). We will draw it at an arbitrary angular position  ϕ . From this we see that there are three forces acting on the differential element: gravity (∆ mg ), the tension force from the differential element above ( T 1 ), and the tension force from the differential element below ( T 2 ). To find how the tension changes with location, we only need to consider the forces acting  along  the rope, which is in the ˆ ρ  direction. Thus, from our free body diagram, we see that the radial component of Newton’s second law is T 2  − T 1  + ∆ mg  cos  ϕ  = ∆ ma ρ , (1) where  a ρ  is the radial component of the acceleration of the differential element. Since the rope stays straight and simply pivots around the point  O p , it is executing circular motion (though the circular motion is not uniform as  ω  is changing). We know that the radial component of the acceleration of an object executing circular motion is the centripetal acceleration  ⃗ a cent  = − ρω 2 ˆ ρ , where  ρ  is the radial location of the differential element that we are considering. We can substitute this to find ∆ T  + ∆ mg  cos  ϕ  =  − ∆ mρω 2 , (2) where we have identified the change in tension across the differential element as ∆ T  =  T 2  − T 1 . Note that there will also be a tangential component of the acceleration  a ϕ  as the rope is experiencing angular acceleration due to gravity, but this does not appear in the  radial  component of Newton’s second law. Next, we can use the density to convert the differential mass to a differential length. Since the rope has a uniform linear mass density, we know that λ  =   m ℓ = ∆ m ∆ ρ ⇒ ∆ m  =   m ℓ ∆ ρ.

Note that you may include the variables  µ s  and  µ k  in your answer. We will show how to solve this problem in each of the two reference frames:  O F  and  O N . Starting with the laboratory “fixed” frame  O F  , we draw the free body diagram for the box shown above (left). From this we see that Newton’s second law in the ˆ y  direction is N  − Mg  =  Ma y ⇒ N  − Mg  = 0 ⇒ N  =  Mg, (1) as we know that even if the box slides it will not accelerate vertically (i.e.  a y  = 0). In the ˆ x direction Newton’s second law is − F f  =  Ma x ⇒ F f  =  − Ma x . (2) In order for the box not to slide, static friction must hold and the box must decelerate together with the train, meaning that  a x  =  − a T  . Substituting this, we find that F f  =  Ma T  . (3) We know that the limit on the magnitude of the static friction force is given by  F f  ≤ µ s N . Substituting equations (1) and (3) into this, we find that the maximum deceleration for which static friction can persist is Ma T  ≤ µ s Mg ⇒ a T  ≤ µ s g. (4) Thus,  a T  =  µ s g  is the critical value above which the box will slide. We can also solve this problem using the reference frame moving with the train  O N , which is non-inertial. In this frame, we must add the fictitious force associated with horizontal translation acceleration,  − MA FN , as shown in the free body diagram above (right). We can already tell that it will have to point in the +ˆ x  direction in order to oppose the friction force and prevent slipping. In the non-inertial reference frame, Newton’s second law in the ˆ y  direction remains as equation (1) since the reference frame does not accelerate vertically. However, in the ˆ x  direction Newton’s second law changes to be − MA FN  − F f  =  Ma x ⇒ − MA FN  − F f  = 0 . (5) 1/6 5 December 2023 Dr. Justin Ball This is because the train is not accelerating when viewed from the reference frame  O N , so we require  a x  = 0 for the box not to slide. The quantity  A FN  represents the horizontal acceleration of the origin of the reference frame  O N  (as seen in  O F  ), so it is simply the acceleration of the train  A FN  =  − a T  . Substituting this, we find that F f  =  Ma T  . (6) The limit on the magnitude of the static friction force is still  F f  ≤ µ s N . Substituting equations (1) and (6) into this gives the final answer of Ma T  ≤ µ s Mg ⇒ a T  ≤ µ s g, (7) which is identical to what we found in the fixed reference frame (i.e. equation (4)). ',\n",

You may assume that •  the gravitational force can be neglected, •  the asteroid may be modeled as a point mass, and •  the planet may be modeled as a rigid sphere with a uniform mass distribution. A Cartesian coordinate system is shown above, which we will use for this problem. It is inertial and defined such that the planet is at rest before it is hit by the asteroid.

       " {'question': 'O x y z h 0 g v 0 Δ y c h f d f R d c In this problem we will investigate the process of a basketball bouncing in great detail. The ball has a radius of  R  and a mass of  m . As shown in the figure above, the ball is thrown purely horizontally from a height  h 0  with an initial speed of  v 0 . It falls under the influence of gravity and impacts the ground, which has a coefficient of static and kinetic friction  µ . As a result of colliding with the ground, the ball temporarily deforms by flattening an  unknown  vertical distance of ∆ y c  that changes with time while in contact with the ground. Given that the elasticity of the ball resists such a deformation, we can model the normal force of the ball on the ground as an ideal spring with a spring constant  k  and an equilibrium length ∆ y c  = 0. The collision with the ground lasts for an  unknown  duration ∆ t c  after which the ball bounces upwards and reaches an  unknown  maximum final height of  h f  at an  unknown horizontal distance  d f  from its starting point. You may assume that •  the ground is flat and horizontal, •  the ball is released without any rotation about its center of mass, •  the deformation is small compared to the radius of the ball (i.e. ∆ y c  ≪ R ) so that the ball can be approximated as a sphere at all times, •  the radius of the ball is very small compared to the height it is thrown from (i.e.  R  ≪ h 0 ), •  the collision time ∆ t c  is very short compared to the time in free fall, •  the coefficients of static and kinetic friction between the ball and ground are both equal to  µ , •  the ball has a uniform mass distribution, •  air drag is negligible, and •  the acceleration due to gravity is  g ˆ y . A Cartesian coordinate system is shown above, which you may use if you wish. The origin is defined to be directly below the initial location of the center of mass of the basketball, at a distance of  R above the level of the ground.

Final exam 4/8 Dr. Justin Ball a. Calculate the horizontal distance traveled by the ball when it first touches the ground  d c . ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'a. In the solutions, we will choose to exclusively use the coordinate system given in the problem statement. It is perfectly fine to define your own coordinate with  ˆ y  pointing upwards, but then  ˆ z  must then point out of the page (for the coordinate system to be right-handed). This will make the earlier parts of this problem easier, but the last part will be harder (as the angular velocity will be in the  − ˆ z  direction). This part of the problem is simple ballistic motion. We can immediately write down the expressions for the positions and velocities in the horizontal and vertical directions, which are x ( t ) =  v x 0 t  +  x 0 (1) v x ( t ) =  v x 0 (2) y ( t ) =   g 2 t 2  +  v y 0 t  +  y 0 (3) v x ( t ) =  gt  +  v y 0 . (4) We see that the terms with  g  are positive (instead of negative as is the case when  ˆ y  points upwards). From the problem statement, we know that the initial conditions are  v x 0  =  v 0 ,  v y 0  = 0 ,  x 0  = 0 , and y 0  =  − h 0 . Thus, our equations of motion become x ( t ) =  v 0 t (5) v x ( t ) =  v 0 (6) y ( t ) =   g 2 t 2  − h 0 (7) v x ( t ) =  gt. (8) To find the location at which the ball hits the ground  d c , we must first calculate the time at which the ball hits the ground  t c . This is defined by  y ( t c ) = 0 . Using equation (7), we see 0 =   g 2 t 2 c   − h 0 ⇒ t c  = s 2 h 0 g  . (9) The horizontal distance traveled in this time is  d c  =  x ( t c ) . Using equations (5) and (9), we find the final answer of d c  =  v 0 s 2 h 0 g  . (10) ',\n",

       " {'question': 'g v i d h h 2 h p ℓ 2 r θ O x y z ϕ In this problem we will model an axe being thrown at a target in order to tip the target over. The axe is composed of a handle with length 4 ℓ and mass  m  and a small metal blade of equal mass  m  that is fixed to one end of the handle. You throw the axe at the target, releasing it such that its center of mass has a horizontal velocity of  v xi  and a vertical velocity of  v yi . You release the axe such that it also rotates around its center of mass with an initial angular velocity of  ω i ˆ z . It leaves your hand with the handle of the axe vertical and the blade at the top end of the handle (as shown in the figure above). You want to hit the target with the blade of the axe. At the moment you release the axe, the target is a horizontal distance  d  and a vertical distance  ℓ above the center of mass of the axe. The target is painted on a board of height 2 h  and thickness 2 r . It is just sitting on the ground and, hence, is free to pivot about an axis in the ˆ z  direction passing though  p  by changing the angle  θ . After the collision, the board and axe together have a total mass  M . The center of mass of the combined object is at the geometric center of the board and the combined moment of inertia about  p  is  I p . You may assume that •  the axe can be modeled as a thin uniform straight rod of mass  m  with a point mass (representing the blade) of mass  m  at one end, •  the angular position of the axe about its center of mass can be quantified by  ϕ  (i.e. the angle from the +ˆ x  vector to the vector running along the axe handle towards the blade), •  the axe is released upright (i.e. the initial angular position is  ϕ i  =  π/ 2), •  the axe is released rotating clockwise (i.e.  ω i  <  0), •  the duration of the collision between the axe and the board is very short, •  the board is free to rotate about  p  and does not translate, •  air drag is negligible, and •  the acceleration due to gravity is  − g ˆ y . A Cartesian coordinate system is shown above, which you may use if you wish. The origin is defined to be the location of the center of mass of the axe at the moment it is released.

Final exam 6/8 Dr. Justin Ball a. Determine the horizontal  x b ( t ) and vertical  y b ( t ) positions of the  blade  of the axe as a function of time  t . Note that you may use  v yi  and  ω i  in your answer (in addition to the variables stated on the previous page). You may find the trigonometric identities sin ( β  +  π/ 2) = cos  β  and cos ( β  +  π/ 2) =  − sin  β  useful. ',\n",
       "  'answer': 'a. The axe exhibits two types of motion as it moves through the air: translation of its center of mass and rotation about its center of mass. Since the only force acting on the axe is gravity, the center of mass follows ballistic motion. Thus, as in problem 2.a, we can immediately write down the expressions for the horizontal and vertical positions of the center of mass, which are x CM ( t ) =  v xi t  +  x i (1) y CM ( t ) =  − g 2 t 2  +  v yi t  +  y i (2) respectively. Note that, because  ˆ y  points upwards in this problem, the gravitational term needs to have a negative sign. The coordinate system is defined such that  x i  = 0  and  y i  = 0 , so we find x CM ( t ) =  v xi t (3) y CM ( t ) =  − g 2 t 2  +  v yi t. (4) Next we must calculate the effect of the rotational motion. First, we must determine the location of center of mass along the handle, to see how far it is from the blade. We will define new coordinate  s , which has its origin at the location of the blade and increases as you move along the handle. In this coordinate system, we know that the center of mass of the handle on its own is at  s h  = 2 ℓ . This is because the handle is uniform and symmetric, so we know that it is midway along its length and the handle is  4 ℓ long. Since we can model the blade as a point mass, its center of mass is at its location of s b  = 0 . Thus, the center of mass of the entire axe (i.e. handle and blade together) is a distance of s CM  = P i   m i s i P i   m i =   ms h  +  ms b m  +  m =  ℓ (5) away from the blade. Since there is no air resistance, while the axe is flying through the air, it experiences no torque. This means the blade of the axe undergoes uniform circular motion with its initial angular velocity of  ω i ˆ z at a radius of  ρ  =  s CM  =  ℓ away from the center of mass. Given such uniform circular motion, we know that the velocity of the blade of the axe around the center of mass is ⃗ v b  =  v ϕ   ˆ ϕ  =  ℓω i   ˆ ϕ  =  ℓω i  ( − sin  ϕ ˆ x  + cos  ϕ ˆ y )  , (6) where we have used the cylindrical coordinate unit vector to Cartesian coordinates using the relation ˆ ϕ  =  − sin  ϕ ˆ x +cos  ϕ ˆ y . We need to perform this conversion because the problem asks us for the position in Cartesian coordinates. We want to find the position, so, since velocity is the derivative of position, we can write d⃗ r b dt   =  ℓω i  ( − sin ( ϕ ( t )) ˆ x  + cos ( ϕ ( t )) ˆ y )  . (7) We would like to integrate this, but one subtlety, which we have made explicit in this formula, is that the angular position  ϕ ( t )  is changing with time. To determine how it varies, we remember that the angular velocity is constant  ω ( t ) =  ω i  and that  ω ( t ) =  dϕ/dt . Combining these two relationships and integrating once in time gives  ϕ ( t ) =  ω i t  +  C . Since the initial condition for the angular position is ϕ (0) =  π/ 2 , we see that  C  =  π/ 2  and the angular position varies with time according to ϕ ( t ) =  ω i t  +   π 2   . (8) 12 19 January 2024 - Solution to the Final Exam Substituting this into equation (7) gives d⃗ r b dt   =  ℓω i \\x10 − sin \\x10 ω i t  +   π 2 \\x11 ˆ x  + cos \\x10 ω i t  +   π 2 \\x11 ˆ y \\x11 =  − ℓω i  (cos ( ω i t ) ˆ x  + sin ( ω i t ) ˆ y )  , (9) where we have made use of the identities given in the question. Now we can directly integrate this expression to find ⃗ r b ( t ) =  − ℓ sin ( ω i t ) ˆ x  +  ℓ cos ( ω i t ) ˆ y  +   ⃗ C, (10) where   ⃗ C  is a constant that is a vector (since the equation is a vector equation). To determine it we use the initial condition that the blade is above the center of mass and a distance of  ℓ away, so  ⃗ r b (0) =  ℓ ˆ y . Applying this initial condition we see that   ⃗ C  = 0 , so equation (10) becomes ⃗ r b ( t ) =  − ℓ sin ( ω i t ) ˆ x  +  ℓ cos ( ω i t ) ˆ y, (11) which is the position of the blade relative to the center of mass. Lastly, we must combine the translational motion (given by equations (3) and (4)) and rotational motion (given by equation (11)) to find the motion of the blade in the laboratory coordinate system defined in the problem statement. This can be accomplished by vector addition as equations (3) and (4) give the position of the center of mass in the laboratory frame and equation (11) gives the position of the blade relative to the center of mass. Thus, we sum the components of equation (11) with equations (3) and (4) to find the final answer x b ( t ) =  v xi t  − ℓ sin ( ω i t ) (12) y b ( t ) =  − g 2 t 2  +  v yi t  +  ℓ cos ( ω i t )  .
