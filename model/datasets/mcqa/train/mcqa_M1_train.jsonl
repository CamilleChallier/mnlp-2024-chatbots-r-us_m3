Let's assume $\\sigma$ is a tanh activation function. Thus, by flipping the signs of all of the weights leading in and out of a hidden neuron, the input-output mapping function represented by the network is unchanged. Besides, interchanging the values of all of the weights (i.e., by permuting the ordering of the hidden neurons within the layer) also leaves the network input-output mapping function unchanged. Suppose that, given the training data, SGD can find a solution with zero training loss, and the (absolute value) weights of such solution are non-zero and all unique. Choose the largest lower bound on the number of solutions (with zero training loss) achievable by $f_{\\mathrm{MLP}}$ with $L=1$ and $M$ hidden units on this dataset.\n\nOptions:\nA. $M! 2^M$\nB. $1$\nC. $2^M$\nD. $M !$"}
